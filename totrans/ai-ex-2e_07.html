    <h1 id="_idParaDest-126" class="chapterTitle">Optimizing Blockchains with Naive Bayes</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this three-part chapter, we will use blockchains to optimize a supply chain using naive Bayes. To achieve this goal, we will first start by understanding how a blockchain is generated using cryptocurrency as an example.</p>
    <p class="normal">Blockchains have entered corporations and are here to stay. Hundreds of major corporations have implemented IBM Hyperledger. Suppliers of these corporations will gradually join the network. Corporate blockchains will provide work for many years to come thanks to the millions of lines of code to update with new features and maintain.</p>
    <p class="normal">Mining cryptocurrency represents the most known use of blockchains. Cryptocurrencies are growing around the world. This chapter starts by explaining how the mining aspect of blockchains works, using bitcoins as an example.</p>
    <p class="normal">We will then move on and analyze how to use blockchains for a different purpose than generating cryptocurrency. Corporations use blockchains to record transactions between companies, for example.</p>
    <p class="normal">IBM was founded in 1911, making it the most experienced company in its field today. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft also offer history-making machine learning platforms. However, IBM offers machine learning platforms that are supported by the 100+ years of experience that the company can bring to bear.</p>
    <p class="normal">Some of IBM's many years in the computer and software market were bumpy. Some terrible decisions caused the company a lot of problems across the world. IBM learned from those mistakes and now offers robust solutions, including IBM Hyperledger for blockchain solutions. IBM advocates using blockchains for corporate transactions.</p>
    <p class="normal">We will finally move to the third part of this chapter, which explains what blockchains mean for companies around the world and how to use the information blockchains to provide optimizing algorithms with artificial intelligence. Naive Bayes will be applied to a blockchain sample to optimize stock levels.</p>
    <p class="normal">The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">The background of blockchain</li>
      <li class="list">Using blockchains to mine bitcoins</li>
      <li class="list">Using blockchains for business transactions</li>

      <li class="list">Naive Bayes</li>
      <li class="list">How to use naive Bayes on blocks of a blockchain to predict further transactions and blocks</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let's begin with a short introduction to blockchain.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-127" class="title">Part I – the background to blockchain technology</h1>
    <p class="normal">In <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>this section, we will go through cryptocurrency mining with blockchains. Producing bitcoins with blockchains made the technology disruptive. The purpose of this section is to understand how the blockchain adventure started before moving on to subsequent uses of blockchain technology.</p>
    <p class="normal">Blockchain technology will transform transactions in every field. Blockchains appeared in 2008. Nobody knows for sure who invented them. Each block contains an encrypted hash of its predecessor (previous block), the DateTime (timestamp) data, and the information regarding the transaction.</p>
    <p class="normal">For more than 1,000 years, transactions have been mostly local book-keeping systems. For the past 100 years, even though the computer age changed the way information was managed, things did not change that much. Each company continued to keep its transactions to itself, only sharing some information through tedious systems.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="bold">Blockchain</strong> makes a transaction <strong class="bold">block</strong> visible to the global network it has been generated in.</p>
    <p class="normal">The fundamental concepts to keep in mind are <strong class="bold">sharing</strong> and <strong class="bold">privacy control</strong>. The two ideas seem to create a cognitive dissonance, something impossible to solve. Yet it has been solved, and it will change the world.</p>
    <p class="normal">When a block (a transaction of any kind) is generated, it is shared with the entire network. Permissions to read the information within that block remain manageable and thus private if the regulator of that block wants the information to stay private.</p>
    <p class="normal">Whether the goal is to mine bitcoins through blocks or use blocks for transactions, artificial intelligence will enhance this innovation shortly.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>coming sections, we'll talk about blockchain and its applications in some further detail. Understanding how to produce blocks for cryptocurrency will enable us to grasp blockchain technology. Once we understand blockchain technology, it is easier to see how this secure encrypted method can be applied to any type of business transaction beyond cryptocurrencies. Let's go mining first!</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-128" class="title">Mining bitcoins</h2>
    <p class="normal">Creating a block in a blockchain does not necessarily have to generate a bitcoin, which is a form of transaction like any other. But understanding how to mine cryptocurrency provides a good way to understand blockchains and how to apply them to many other fields.</p>
    <p class="normal">Mining a bitcoin means creating a mathematical block for a valid transaction and adding this block to the chain; the blockchain:</p>
    <p class="center"><em class="italics">Blockchain</em> = {<em class="italics">block</em><sub>1</sub>, <em class="italics">block</em><sub>2</sub>, <em class="italics">the block just added</em> … <em class="italics">block</em><sub style="font-style: italic;">n</sub>}</p>
    <p class="normal">The blockchain <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>cannot go back in time. It is like a time-dating feature in life. At minute <em class="italics">m</em>, you do something, at minute <em class="italics">m</em> + 1 something else, at minute <em class="italics">m</em> + <em class="italics">n</em> something else, and so on. You cannot travel back in time. <em class="italics">What is done is done</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">When a block is added to the bitcoin chain, there is no way of undoing the transaction.</p>
    <p class="normal">The global network of bitcoin mining<a id="_idIndexMarker303"/> consists of <strong class="bold">nodes</strong>. With the appropriate software, you leave a port open, allocate around 150+ GB of disk space, and generate new blocks. The nodes communicate with each other, and the information is relayed to the other nodes around the whole network.</p>
    <p class="normal">For a node to be a miner, it must solve complex mathematical puzzles that are part of the bitcoin program.</p>
    <p class="normal">To solve the puzzle, the software must find a number that fits in a specific range when combined with the data in the block being generated. The number is passed through a hash function.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can call the number a <strong class="bold">nonce</strong>, and it is used only once. For example, an integer between 0 and 4,294,967,296 for a bitcoin must be generated.</p>
    <p class="normal">The process is random. The software generates a number, passes it through the hash function, and sends it out to the network. The first <strong class="bold">miner</strong> who produces a number in the expected range informs the whole network<a id="_idIndexMarker304"/> that that particular block has been generated. The rest of the network stops working on that block and moves on to another one.</p>
    <p class="normal">The reward for <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>the miner is naturally paid out in bitcoins. It represents a lot of money, but it's hard to get, considering the competition in the network and the cost required (CPU, electricity, disk space, and time) to produce correct results.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">A constant balance must be maintained between the cost of mining a bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, and the amount received for mining it.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Having talked about mining bitcoin, we'll briefly discuss actually using cryptocurrency.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-129" class="title">Using cryptocurrency</h2>
    <p class="normal">Be very careful with<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> cryptocurrency. There are now 1,500+ cryptocurrencies. The concept sounds fascinating, but the result remains currency. Currency can be volatile, and you can lose your life's savings in less than an hour if a crash occurs.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Golden rule</strong>: If you cannot resist investing in cryptocurrencies, do not invest more than you can afford to lose.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">That being said, to use cryptocurrency, first set up a wallet to store your bitcoins, for example. The wallet can be online, through a provider, or even offline.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once that is done, you will be able to purchase bitcoins as you wish in hard cash or using credit cards, debit cards, and transfers.</p>
    <p class="normal">Remember, you are buying these currencies like any other currency with all the potential, but also all the risks involved.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we saw how the blockchain era began with bitcoin production to understand how to mine cryptocurrencies through bitcoins using a blockchain. With the original way blockchains are created in mind, we can apply blockchains to many other fields.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the second part of our three-part chapter, we will see how to use blockchains beyond cryptocurrencies. We will apply them to supply chains.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-130" class="title">PART II – using blockchains to share information in a supply chain</h1>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="italics">Part I – the background to blockchain technology</em>, we saw how to use blockchains to mine cryptocurrencies. That<a id="_idIndexMarker307"/> prerequisite to<a id="_idIndexMarker308"/> entering the world of blockchains having been achieved, this section will show how to use blockchains in a supply chain. This will not involve cryptocurrencies. It opens the path to innovating blockchains with AI.</p>
    <p class="normal">A supply chain is a chain of production and service that gets a product from a starting point to the consumer. For example, take a roll of fabric (cloth) that is shipped from India to Tunisia. In Tunisia, the fabric is cut into patterns and assembled as clothing. Then the clothing is shipped to France where it is packaged in a box with a brand printed on it. It then goes on to be stored in a warehouse to be shipped to a physical shop or directly to an online customer. We can sum this supply chain up as follows:</p>
    <p class="center"><em class="italics">Cloth from India</em> -&gt; <em class="italics">cut and assembled in Tunisia</em> -&gt; <em class="italics">shipped to France</em> -&gt; <em class="italics">packaged</em> -&gt; <em class="italics">stored</em> -&gt; <em class="italics">shipped to a shop or directly to a consumer</em></p>
    <p class="normal">A supply chain process such as an apparel production and delivery system involves thousands of people along the way: production sites, transport personnel, warehouse employees, and management teams for each step of the chain.</p>
    <p class="normal">This is where a modern blockchain technology comes in handy to track all of the transactions down in one system.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the following example, we will take six companies named A, B, C, D, E, and F. In <em class="italics">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italics">Getting Started with Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence through Reinforcement Learning</em>, we used a size six reward matrix. In that chapter, we used A, B, C, D, E, and F to represent locations in a Markov decision process for reinforcement learning. At the end of the chapter, we saw that the reward matrix could be applied to many different domains. In our case, we will refer to the six items (A, B, C, D, E, and F) as companies and their locations (one per company in this example) in a supply chain process.</p>
    <p class="normal">Each company, A to F, that is a member of the supply chain using blockchains can optimize its activity. Instead of each company having separate transaction ledgers, one central blockchain will contain all of the transactions (blocks):</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">How much and when the cloth left India</li>
      <li class="list">When it got on a ship and how long it took</li>
      <li class="list">When the ship got to Tunisia</li>
      <li class="list">… all of the intermediate activities right down to the consumer</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">With such data, the blocks (records of the transactions) of a blockchain have become machine learning goldmines to detect information and make predictions. One profitable reason for using this system is to reduce stock levels. Piling up unsold goods to anticipate sales is costly and can ruin a company's profit. On the contrary, if each company in the supply chain can see the stock levels and real needs of the other partners through the blocks of the blockchain, they can fit their stock levels to the exact need and save huge amounts of money!</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's see how this works using IBM software as an example.</p>
    <p class="normal">IBM Blockchain, based on Hyperledger Fabric, provides a way for companies around the world to share a blockchain transaction network without worrying about mining or using cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p class="normal">The system is based<a id="_idIndexMarker309"/> on the Linux Foundation<a id="_idIndexMarker310"/> project. Hyperledger is an open source collaborative project hosted by the Linux Foundation.</p>
    <p class="normal">At this level, Hyperledger uses blockchains to guarantee secure transactions without trying to optimize the cryptocurrency aspect. The software generates blocks in a blockchain network shared by all the parties involved, but they do not have to purchase cryptocurrencies in the currency sense—only in the technological sense.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the following graph, we will use the six nodes (companies A to F) to illustrate how the Markov decision process we studied in <em class="italics">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italics">Getting Started with Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence through Reinforcement Learning</em>, can be applied to a blockchain:</p>

    <p class="normal">With millions of commercial transactions per year with a huge amount of transportation (truck, train, boat, air), it is increasingly complicated to manage this type of network effectively in the 21st century without a solution like IBM Hyperledger.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">With IBM Hyperledger, the companies have <strong class="bold">one</strong> online transaction ledger with smart contracts (online) and real-time tracking.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">The transactions<a id="_idIndexMarker313"/> are secure; they can be<a id="_idIndexMarker314"/> private or public among the members of the network, and they provide real-time optimization information for an artificial intelligence solution.</p>

    <p class="normal"><em class="italics">IBM Hyperledger provides artificial intelligence developers with a unique advantage over any other dataset—a 100% reliable dataset updated in real time.</em></p>
    <p class="normal">Each <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>company member (A to F) of the network will create a<a id="_idIndexMarker316"/> block for each transaction so that an AI analyst can have access to the data to make forecasts.

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-132" class="title">Creating a block</h2>
    <p class="normal">A block is <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>formed using the method described for mining a bitcoin, except that this time, currency is not a goal. The goal is a secure transaction with a smart contract when necessary. The following screenshot is a standard IBM interface that can be customized:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_07_02.png" alt="C:\Users\gauravg\Desktop\9946\Chapter 14\B09940_14_02.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.2: Standard IBM interface</p>
    <p class="normal">You can see the individual and unique blocks that make up a blockchain. Each block in IBM Hyperledger has a unique number. In this example, it is <strong class="bold">111</strong> with a zoom on block <strong class="bold">103</strong>.</p>
    <p class="normal">A block in the <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>supply chain network in our graph (A to F) can be the purchase of a product X with a contract. The transaction can be between companies A and B, for example. The next block can be the transportation of that product to another location from A to B, for example, within the blockchain network.</p>
    <p class="normal">The information attached to that block is in the Hyperledger repository: company name (A to F), address, phone number, transaction description, and any other type of data required by the network of companies. Each block can be viewed by all or some depending on the permission properties attached to it.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-133" class="title">Exploring the blocks</h2>
    <p class="normal">Exploring the <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>blocks provides an artificial intelligence program with a gold mine: a real-life, and 100% reliable, dataset.</p>
    <p class="normal">The interesting part for AI optimization is the block information, as described in the following screenshot. The present block was added to the chain along with the previous block and the transaction code:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_07_03.png" alt="https://packt-type-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/2134/2018/05/B09946_14_01-1.png"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.3: Exploring the blockchain</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice that the block hash (see the preceding mining section) of a given block is linked to the previous block hash and possesses a unique transaction code.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once we have our set of blocks as data (the type of transaction, date, amount), we can start to build an AI prediction algorithm. IBM provides extraction possibilities through scripts and other tools.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Once we have a dataset containing blocks of the blockchain, the goal of the prediction will be to determine the stock level category to see whether a fellow member of the supply chain network (A to F) needs to be replenished.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">The blocks of <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>the blockchain provide data that can be used to predict the type of stock levels that the network will be facing after each transaction. Each company will be able to run a prediction algorithm that uses the existing data to predict the potential replenishing required. For example, company A might detect that company B needs more of its cloth.</p>
    <p class="normal">Considering the amount of data, a prediction algorithm such as naive Bayes can do the job.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-134" class="title">Part III – optimizing a supply chain with naive Bayes in a blockchain process</h1>
    <p class="normal">Naive Bayes will use some of the critical information as <strong class="bold">features</strong> to optimize warehouse storage and product availability in a<a id="_idIndexMarker321"/> real-time process.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Naive Bayes learning<a id="_idIndexMarker322"/> function will learn from the previous <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>blocks on how to predict the next blocks (supplying another company that needs more stock) that should be inserted in the blockchain. The blocks will be inserted in a dataset just like any other form of timestamped data to make predictions.</p>
    <p class="normal">Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem applies conditional probability, defined as follows:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_07_001.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">A</em>|<em class="italics">B</em>) is a <strong class="bold">posterior probability</strong>, the <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>probability of <em class="italics">A</em> after having observed some events (<em class="italics">B</em>). It is also a <strong class="bold">conditional probability</strong>: the<a id="_idIndexMarker325"/> likelihood of <em class="italics">A</em> happening given <em class="italics">B</em> has already happened.</li>
      <li class="list"><em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">B</em>|<em class="italics">A</em>) is the probability of <em class="italics">B</em> given the prior observations <em class="italics">A</em>. It is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of <em class="italics">B</em> happening given <em class="italics">A</em> has already happened.</li>
      <li class="list"><em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">A</em>) is the probability of <em class="italics">A</em> prior to the observations.</li>
      <li class="list"><em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">B</em>) is the probability of the predictions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Naive Bayes, although based on Bayes' theorem, assumes that the features in a class are <strong class="bold">independent</strong> of each other. In many cases, this makes predictions more practical to implement. The statistical presence of features, related or not, will produce a prediction. As long as the prediction remains sufficiently efficient, naive Bayes provides a good solution.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-135" class="title">A naive Bayes example</h2>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker326"/> will first illustrate naive Bayes with a mathematical example before writing the Python program. The goal of this section is just to understand the concepts involved in naive Bayes. </p>
    <p class="normal">This section is not a development chapter but a chapter to understand the underlying concepts of the real-life example and the mathematics used to make predictions.</p>
    <p class="normal">The blockchains in this chapter represent information on the stock levels based on manufactured goods in the apparel industry. For more, read <em class="italics">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italics">AI and the Internet of Things (IoT)</em>, which describes an AI-optimized apparel manufacturing process in detail.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will focus on storage. The load of a sewing station in the apparel industry is expressed in <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>quantities in <strong class="bold">stock keep units</strong> (<strong class="bold">SKUs</strong>). An SKU, for example, can be product P: a pair of jeans of a given size.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once the garment has been produced, it goes into storage. At that point, a block in a blockchain can represent that transaction with two useful features for a machine learning algorithm:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">The day the garment was stored</li>
      <li class="list">The total quantity of that SKU garment now in storage</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">A block in a blockchain contains both the day (timestamp) and quantity stored in the transaction information.</p>
    <p class="normal">Since the blockchain contains<a id="_idIndexMarker328"/> the storage blocks of all A, B, C, D, E, and F corporate locations that are part of the network, a machine learning program can access the data and make predictions.</p>
    <p class="normal">The goal is to spread the stored quantities of the given product evenly over the six locations, as represented in the following histogram:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_07_04.png" alt="https://packt-type-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/2134/2018/05/B09946_14_04-1.jpg"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.4: Histogram of the storage level of the product distributed over six locations</p>
    <p class="normal">This screenshot shows<a id="_idIndexMarker329"/> the storage level of product P distributed over six locations. Each location in this blockchain network is a <strong class="bold">hub</strong>. A hub<a id="_idIndexMarker330"/> in <strong class="bold">supply chain management</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCM</strong>) is <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>often an intermediate storage warehouse. For example, to cover the area of these six locations, the same product will be stored at each location. This way, local trucks can come and pick the goods for delivery.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="italics">The goal is to have an available product P at point location L (A to F) when needed.</em></p>
    <p class="normal">For example, the delivery time from a location <em class="italics">L</em> to a location point <em class="italics">a</em><sub>1</sub> (a store or home) will only take a few hours. If A did not store P, then the finer consumer would have to wait for the product to travel from C to A, for example.</p>
    <p class="normal">If the blockchain network is well organized, one location can specialize in producing product P (best production costs) and evenly distribute the quantity stored in the six locations, including itself.</p>
    <p class="normal">By having evenly balanced storage quantities at all locations, the system will flow in a continuous delivery process.</p>
    <p class="normal">In our example, a company = its location (A to F). Using the blocks of the blockchain of these six members, we can predict when a given storage point (A to F) requires replenishing to reduce waiting times, for example.</p>
    <p class="normal">Using blockchains to optimize the storage levels is an efficient new approach to reducing costs while delivering to customers faster.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-136" class="title">The blockchain anticipation novelty</h3>
    <p class="normal">In former days, all the warehouses<a id="_idIndexMarker332"/> at those six locations (A to F) had to ensure the minimum storage level for each location. Since they did not know what was happening in their supply chain network in real time, they often stored more products than required, which increased their costs, or did not store enough, leading to delivery problems.</p>
    <p class="normal">In a world of real-time production and selling, distributors need to predict <strong class="bold">demand</strong>. The system needs to be <strong class="bold">demand-driven</strong>. Naive Bayes can solve that problem.</p>
    <p class="normal">It will take the first two features into account:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">DAY</strong>: The day the garment was stored</li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">STOCK</strong>: The total quantity of that SKU garment now in storage</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Then it will add a novelty—<em class="italics">the number of blocks related to product P</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">A high number of blocks at a given date means that this product was in demand in general (production, distribution). The more blocks there are, the more transactions there are. Also, if the storage levels (the STOCK feature) are diminishing, this is an indicator; it means storage levels must be replenished. The DAY feature timestamps the history of the product.</p>
    <p class="normal">The block feature is named <strong class="bold">BLOCKS</strong>. Since all share the blockchain, a machine learning program can access reliable global data in seconds. The dataset reliability provided by blockchains constitutes a<a id="_idIndexMarker333"/> motivation in itself to optimize storage levels using the blocks of the blockchains as datasets.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-137" class="title">The goal – optimizing storage levels using blockchain data</h3>
    <p class="normal">The goal is to <em class="italics">maintain stock at low levels</em> by<a id="_idIndexMarker334"/> providing fast delivery when product requests are made. To make a decision, the ML solution will <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>analyze the blocks of a blockchain in real time.</p>
    <p class="normal">The program will take the DAY, STOCK, and BLOCKS (number of) features for a given product P and produce a result. The result predicts whether this product P will be in demand. If the answer is yes (or 1), the demand for this product requires anticipation.</p>
    <h4 class="title">Step 1 – defining the dataset</h4>
    <p class="normal">The dataset contains <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>raw data from prior events in a sequence, which makes it perfect for prediction algorithms. Blocks can be extracted using scripts from IBM Hyperledger, for example. This constitutes a unique opportunity to see the data of all companies without having to build a database. The raw dataset will look like the following list:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_07_05.png" alt="https://packt-type-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/2134/2018/05/B09946_14_02.jpg"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.5: Raw dataset</p>
    <p class="normal">This dataset contains the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Blocks</code> of product P present in the blockchain on day <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">x</code> having scanned the blockchain back by 30 days. <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No</code> means no significant amounts of blocks have been found. <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Yes</code> means a significant number of blocks have been found. If blocks have been found, this means that there is a demand for this product somewhere along the blockchain.</li>
      <li class="list"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Some_blocks</code> means that <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>blocks have been found, but they are too sparse to be taken into account without overfitting the prediction. However, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Yes</code> will contribute to the prediction as well as <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No</code>.</li>
      <li class="list"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No_blocks</code> means there is no demand at all, sparse or otherwise (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Some_blocks</code>), numerous (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Blocks</code>) or not. This means trouble for this product, P.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The goal is to avoid predicting demand on sparse (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Some_blocks</code>) or absent (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No_blocks</code>) products. This example is trying to predict a potential <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Yes</code> for numerous blocks for this product P. Only if <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Yes</code> is predicted can the system trigger the automatic demand process (see the <em class="italics">Implementation of naive Bayes in Python</em> section later in the chapter).</p>
    <h4 class="title">Step 2 – calculating the frequency</h4>
    <p class="normal">Looking at the following <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>frequency table provides additional information:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_07_06.png" alt="https://packt-type-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/2134/2018/05/B09946_14_03-1.jpg"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.6: Frequency table</p>
    <p class="normal">The <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Yes</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No</code> statuses of each feature (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Blocks</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Some_blocks</code>, or <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No_blocks</code>) for a given product P for a given period (past 30 days) have been grouped by frequency.</p>
    <p class="normal">The sum is on the bottom line for each <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No</code> feature and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Yes</code> feature. For example, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Yes</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No_blocks</code> add up to 2.</p>
    <p class="normal">Some additional information will prove useful for the final calculation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">The total <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>number of samples = 10.</li>
      <li class="list">The total number of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Yes</code> samples = 8.</li>
      <li class="list">The total number of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No</code> samples = 2.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="title">Step 3 – calculating the likelihood</h4>
    <p class="normal">Now that the <strong class="bold">frequency</strong> table<a id="_idIndexMarker340"/> has been calculated, the following <strong class="bold">likelihood</strong> table is produced using that data:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_07_07.png" alt="https://packt-type-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/2134/2018/05/B09946_14_05-300x97.jpg"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.7: Likelihood table</p>
    <p class="normal">The table contains the following statistics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No</code> = 2 = 20% = 0.2</li>
      <li class="list"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Yes</code> = 8 = 80%=0.8</li>
      <li class="list"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Some_blocks</code> = 2 = 20%=0.2</li>
      <li class="list"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">No_blocks</code> = 3 = 30%=0.3</li>
      <li class="list"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Blocks</code> = 5 = 50%=0.5</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Blocks</code> represent an important proportion of the samples, which means that along with <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Some_blocks</code>, the demand looks good.</p>
    <h4 class="title">Step 4 – applying the naive Bayes equation</h4>
    <p class="normal">The goal now is to<a id="_idIndexMarker341"/> represent each variable of the Bayes' theorem in a naive Bayes equation to obtain the probability of having <strong class="bold">demand</strong> for product P and trigger a purchase scenario for the blockchain network. Bayes' theorem can be expressed as follows:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_07_001.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">Yes</em>|<em class="italics">Blocks</em>) = <em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">Blocks</em>|<em class="italics">Yes</em>) * <em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">Yes</em>)/<em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">Blocks</em>)</li>
      <li class="list"><em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">Yes</em>) = 8/10 = 0.8</li>
      <li class="list"><em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">Blocks</em>) = 5/10 = 0.5</li>
      <li class="list"><em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">Blocks</em>|<em class="italics">Yes</em>) = 4/8 = 0.5</li>
      <li class="list"><em class="italics">P</em>(<em class="italics">Yes</em>|<em class="italics">Blocks</em>) = (0.5*0.8)/0.5 = 0.8</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The demand looks acceptable. However, penalties are necessary, and other factors must be considered as well (transportation availability through other block exploration processes).</p>
    <p class="normal">This example and method show the concept of the naive Bayes approach. This example is meant to be nothing other than a simplified mathematical explanation of the philosophy of Bayes' theorem.</p>
    <p class="normal">By doing this <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>calculation from scratch, we now know the basic concepts of Bayes' theorem: using prior values to predict future events taking several features into account.</p>
    <p class="normal">We will now move from this theoretical approach to the implementation phase. We will build a program using naive Bayes in Python.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-138" class="title">Implementation of naive Bayes in Python</h2>
    <p class="normal">This section <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>shows how to use a stock level optimizer version of naive <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>Bayes. Blockchains provide exceptionally reliable datasets for ML miners looking for areas to optimize and generate profit. Choosing the right model remains the key challenge.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-139" class="title">Gaussian naive Bayes</h3>
    <p class="normal">We will be implementing<a id="_idIndexMarker345"/> Gaussian naive Bayes because it fits the apparel industry. For example, if you sell dresses, there will be a target middle size <em class="italics">S</em>. The marketing department knows that this size <em class="italics">S</em> will represent most of the sales. The larger <em class="italics">S</em> + <em class="italics">n</em> sizes and small <em class="italics">S</em> – <em class="italics">n</em> will generate fewer sales, creating a Gaussian curve.</p>
    <p class="normal">In implementation mode, a dataset with raw data from the blockchain will be used without the feature interpretation function of naive Bayes in the following table:</p>

    <p class="normal">We now know what a <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>blockchain is and how to use the blocks of a blockchain to optimize the stock levels of the locations of a network of companies (A to F). We also know the basic concepts of Bayes' theorem and naive Bayes. </p>
    <p class="normal">With this in mind, we can build a Python program to predict the stock level categories of incoming blocks of a blockchain. These predictions will help local managers increase their stock levels to meet the demand of their partners (companies A to F) in the supply chain they are part of.</p>
    <p class="normal">The Python <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">naive_bayes_blockchains.py</code> program uses a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">sklearn</code> class. Consider the following snippet:</p>

</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">It reads the dataset into the data structure. The following code reads <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">data_BC.csv</code> into <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">df</code>:</p>

    <p class="normal">This is a replenishment program. It will mimic the demand. When no demand is found, nothing happens; when demand is found, it triggers a purchase block. Some chain stores know the number of garments purchased on a given day (or week or another unit) and automatically purchase that amount. Others have other purchasing rules. Finding business rules is part of the consulting aspect of a project.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this section, we implemented naive Bayes to predict the categories of the incoming blocks. If the demand is high, then a supply chain manager will know that more products need to be stored.</p>
    <p class="normal">If the demand is low, the<a id="_idIndexMarker350"/> manager will avoid storing more products. Blocks in a blockchain provide reliable datasets for a program that scans the blocks 24/7 and generates recommendations in real time.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-140" class="title">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">The reliable sequence of blocks in a blockchain has opened the door to endless machine learning algorithms. Naive Bayes appears to be a practical way to start optimizing the blocks of a blockchain. It calculates correlations and makes predictions by learning the independent features of a dataset, irrespective of whether the relationship is conditional or not.</p>
    <p class="normal">This freestyle prediction approach fits the open-minded spirit of blockchains that are being propagated by the millions today with limitless resources.</p>
    <p class="normal">IBM Hyperledger takes blockchain's "Frontierland" development to another level with the Linux Foundation project. IBM also offers a cloud platform and services.</p>
    <p class="normal">IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google provide cloud platforms with an arsenal of disruptive machine learning algorithms. This provides a smooth approach to your market or department, along with the ability to set up a blockchain prototype online in a short space of time. With this approach, you can enter some additional prototype data in the model, export the data, or use an API to read the block sequences. Then, you will be able to apply machine learning algorithms to these reliable datasets. The only limit is our imagination.</p>
    <p class="normal">The next chapter will lead us into more AI power as we explore the world of neural networks.</p>
