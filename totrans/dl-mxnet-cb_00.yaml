- en: MXNet is an open-source deep learning framework that allows you to train and
    deploy neural network models and implement **state-of-the-art** (**SOTA**) architectures
    in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and more. With this cookbook,
    you will be able to construct fast, scalable deep learning solutions using Apache
    MXNet.

- en: This book will start by showing you the different versions of MXNet and what
    version to choose before installing your library. You will learn to start using
    MXNet/Gluon libraries to solve classification and regression problems and get
    an idea on the inner workings of these libraries. This book will also show how
    to use MXNet to analyze toy datasets in the areas of numerical regression, data
    classification, image classification, and text classification. You’ll also learn
    to build and train deep-learning neural network architectures from scratch, before
    moving on to complex concepts like transfer learning. You’ll learn to construct
    and deploy neural network architectures including CNN, RNN, Transformers, and
    integrate these models into your applications. You will also learn to analyze
    the performance of these models, and fine-tune them for increased accuracy, scalability,
    and speed.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B16591_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016)*, Up and Running with MXNet*,
    To start working with MXNet, we need to install the library. There are several
    different versions of MXNet available to be installed, and in this chapter, we
    will cover how to help you choose the right version. The most important parameter
    will be the available hardware we have. In order to optimize performance, it is
    always best to maximize the use of our available Hardware. We will compare the
    usage of a well-known linear algebra library, NumPy, and how MXNet provides similar
    operations. We will then compare the performance of the different MXNet versions
    vs. Numpy.'

    Datasets: Gluon and DataLoader*, In this chapter, we will start using MXNet to
    analyze some toy datasets in the domains of numerical regression, data classification,
    image classification and text classification. To manage those tasks efficiently,
    we will see new MXNet libraries and functions such as Gluon and DataLoader.'

    In this chapter, we will learn how to use MXNet and Gluon libraries to apply supervised
    learning to solve regression problems. We will explore and understand a house
    prices dataset and will learn how to predict the price of a house. To achieve
    this objective, we will train neural networks and study the effect of the different
    hyper-parameters.'

    In this chapter, we will learn how to use MXNet and Gluon libraries to apply supervised
    learning to solve classification problems. We will explore and understand a flowers
    dataset and will learn how to predict the type of a flower given some metrics.

    and operations available in MXNet/GluonCV to work with images. Furthermore, the
    readers will get introduced to classic Computer Vision problems: Image Classification,
    Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation. They will then learn how to leverage

    Learning and Fine-Tuning*, In this chapter, the reader will understand how to
    optimize pre-trained models for specific tasks using Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning
    techniques. Furthermore, the readers will compare the performance of these techniques
    against training a model from scratch and the trade-offs involved. The reader
    will apply these techniques to problems such as image classifcation, image segmentation
    and translating text from English to German.'

    a working environment with Python 3.7+. A good theoretical understanding of mathematics
    for deep learning will be beneficial. MXNet 1.9.1 and the supplementary GluonCV
    and GluonNLP libraries will need to be installed as well (versions 0.10). These
    MXNet/Gluon requirements are described in detail in [*Chapter 1*](B16591_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016)
    and can be followed along by the reader. All code examples have been tested with
    Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.10.12, MXNet 1.9.1, GluonCV 0.10 and GluonNLP 0.10\. However,
    they should work with future releases too.
