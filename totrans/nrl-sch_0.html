<p>We live in the digital era, and creating data becomes easier every day. According to Forbes, we generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day, and this data comes from all types of sources. It can be pictures on Instagram, voice messages on Telegram, videos, text, or even a combination of all of them. This was definitely not the case when the internet was just starting. And yet, despite the obvious difference in the easiness of data creation before and now, we keep using the same search techniques. Despite having an incredible boom in data generation, we haven’t updated our search techniques that much.</p>
<p>Neural search is the approach to changing that. It takes advantage of the <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) era that we live in right now and uses the latest AI research to deliver novel search techniques. However, despite this being a good technique, it presents a lot of challenges. Neural search is a whole new concept, which means the knowledge and techniques needed are also new. To effectively deploy a neural search application, the engineers in charge of it need to have a plethora of skills, from engineering to Dev-Ops, and an ML background.</p>
<p>This is the problem Jina AI wants to solve. Jina is an open source solution that is designed to democratize AI and neural search, making it easier for many developers to have a full end-to-end neural search application without having to have a background in ML, the cloud, and backend engineering. It’s designed with Python developers in mind to help them unlock the full potential of the latest neural search techniques. In this book, we will explore the basics of search, from traditional to neural search. With this knowledge, we will work through hands-on examples of creating a fully fledged neural application.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>If you are an ML, <strong class="bold">deep learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">DL</strong>), or AI engineer interested in building a search system of any kind (text, QA, image, audio, PDF, 3D models, and so on) using modern software architecture, this book is for you. This book is also excellent for Python engineers who are interested in building a search system (of any kind) using state-of-the-art DL techniques.</p>

<p><a href="B17488_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">System Design and Engineering Challenges</em>, will cover the basics of designing a search system. In this chapter, you will learn the core concepts associated with search, such as indexing and querying, and how to use this to save and retrieve information.</p>
<p><a href="B17488_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Learning Jina</em>’<em class="italic">s Basics</em>, will cover the steps required to implement your own search engine. In this chapter, you will learn the core concepts of Jina in detail, along with their overall design and how they connect with each other.</p>
<p><a href="B17488_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor068"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Multiple Search Modalities</em>, will introduce you to the concept of multi-modal and cross-modal search, where you can combine multiple modalities, such as text, image, audio, and video, to build state-of-the-art search systems.</p>
<p><a href="B17488_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Basic Practical Examples with Jina</em>, will cover beginner-friendly real-world applications of Jina’s neural search framework by building on the concepts learned in the previous chapters.</p>
<p><a href="B17488_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring Advanced Use Cases of Jina</em>, will cover the advanced applications of Jina’s neural search framework by using the concepts learned in the previous chapters. It will focus on explaining challenging concepts in neural search using real-world examples.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>To be able to make the most of this book, you are expected to write programs with Python and have knowledge of ML and DL. It would be even better to have a basic understanding of information retrieval and the search problem.</p>
