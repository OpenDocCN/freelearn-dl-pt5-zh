<p><span>This section will demonstrate reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning. The reader will learn how reinforcement learning differs from both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The reader will use this machine learning technique in a number of situations to solve problems where discrete actions lead to an increased or reduced probability of a positive outcome.</span></p>
