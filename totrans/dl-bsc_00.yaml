- en: Deep learning is rapidly becoming the most preferred way of solving data problems.
    This is thanks, in part, to its huge variety of mathematical algorithms and their
    ability to find patterns that are otherwise invisible to us.

- en: '*Deep Learning from the Basics* begins with a fast-paced introduction to deep
    learning with Python, its definition, characteristics, and applications. You''ll
    learn how to use the Python interpreter for the script files. You''ll also learn
    how to utilize NumPy and Matplotlib in your deep learning applications. As you
    progress through the book, you''ll discover backpropagation—an efficient way to
    calculate the gradients of weight parameters—and study multilayer perceptrons
    and their limitations before finally implementing a three-layer neural network
    and calculating multidimensional arrays.'

- en: '*Deep Learning from the Basics* is designed for data scientists, data analysts,
    and developers who want to use deep learning techniques to develop efficient solutions.
    This book is ideal for those who want a deeper understanding as well as an overview
    of the technologies. Some working knowledge of Python is a must. Knowledge of
    NumPy and pandas will be beneficial but not essential.'
