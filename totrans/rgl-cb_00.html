<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
<p>Have you ever wondered why so many machine learning projects fail <span class="No-Break">in production?</span></p>
<p>In many cases, this is because of a lack of generalization of models, leading to unexpected predictions when facing new, unseen data. This is what regularization is about: making sure a model provides the expected predictions, even when facing <span class="No-Break">new data.</span></p>
<p>In this book, we will explore many forms of regularization. To accomplish this, we will explore two primary avenues for regularization solutions, depending on the recipes in <span class="No-Break">the chapter</span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>When given a machine learning model, how do we regularize it? Regularizing is most suited in applications where the model is already imposed (whether there is a legacy solution to be updated or strong requirements) and the training data is fixed, so the only solution is to regularize the model.</li>
<li>Given a machine learning task, how do we get a robust, well-generalizing solution? This approach is most suited in applications where only the problem is defined, but no strong constraints have been provided yet, so more solutions can be explored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, these recipes will provide you with the necessary tools and techniques to solve most of the machine learning problems you may face that require regularization, as well as a solid practical understanding of the <span class="No-Break">underlying concepts.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is suitable for anyone with prior Python knowledge: the only strong requirement to fully understand the proposed solutions is that you can read and run simple Python code. For each new method or model that is introduced, some context and practical explanations are provided, so that anyone with a computer science background can fully understand what they <span class="No-Break">are doing.</span></p>
<p>Although any Python practitioner is able to follow this book, the main target audience is <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning practitioners, such as machine learning engineers, applied scientists, and data scientists, who want ready-to-use methods and code to pick from whenever they face a new problem or task. Using this book, hopefully they can handle many situations by slightly adapting the code to their own problems.</li>
<li>Machine learning enthusiasts who want to gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of machine learning, with concrete examples and working code. Using this book, they can get deep knowledge with hands-on examples and build a solid portfolio of projects.</li>
</ul>

Starting with a Perceptron, we then train models for regression <span class="No-Break">and classification.</span></p>
<p><a href="B19629_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor185"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Deep Learning Regularization</em>, covers regularization for deep learning models. Several techniques are explored and explained: L2 penalization, early stopping, network architecture, <span class="No-Break">and dropout.</span></p>

It starts by explaining what they are and how to train such models. Regularization techniques are then covered, such as dropout and maximum <span class="No-Break">sequence length.</span></p>
<p><a href="B19629_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor227"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Advanced Regularization in Natural Language Processing</em>, explores regularization methods specific to <strong class="bold">Natural Language Processing</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLP</strong>). Regularization using word2vec embeddings and BERT embeddings is covered. Data augmentation with word2vec and GPT-3 is explored. Zero-shot inference solutions are <span class="No-Break">also proposed.</span></p>
<p><a href="B19629_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor255"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Regularization in Computer Vision</em>, dives into regularization for computer vision and <strong class="bold">Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">CNNs</strong>). After explaining CNNs conceptually and practically on classification, recipes with regularization for object detection and semantic segmentation <span class="No-Break">are provided.</span></p>
<p><a href="B19629_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor281"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Regularization in Computer Vision</em><em class="italic"> –</em><em class="italic"> Synthetic Image Generation</em>, dives deeper into synthetic image generation for regularization. Simple data augmentation is first explored. Then, a QR code object detection mechanism is built with only synthetic training data. Finally, we explore a real-time style transfer whose training is based on Stable Diffusion data, as well as explain how to work with such a dataset <span class="No-Break">by yourself.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>You will need a version of Python installed. All the code has been tested with Python 3.10 on Ubuntu 22.04, with CUDA version 12.1. However, it should work with Python 3.9 and later versions, on any OS, and with CUDA version 11 <span class="No-Break">and later.</span></p>
