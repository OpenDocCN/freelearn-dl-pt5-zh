    <h1 id="_idParaDest-406" class="chapterTitle">Answers to the Questions</h1>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-407" class="title">Chapter 1 – Getting Started with Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence through Reinforcement Learning</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Is reinforcement learning memoryless? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. Reinforcement learning is memoryless. The agent calculates the next state without looking into the past. This is significantly different from humans. Humans rely heavily on memory. A CPU-based reinforcement learning system finds solutions without experience. Human intelligence merely proves that intelligence can solve a problem. No more, no less. An adaptive thinker can then imagine new forms of machine intelligence.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">It must be noted that exceptions exist in some cases, but the general rule is a memoryless system.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Does reinforcement learning use stochastic (random) functions? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. In the particular Markov decision process model, the choices are random. In just two questions, you can see that the Bellman equation is memoryless and makes random decisions. No human reasons like that. Being an adaptive thinker is a leap of faith. You have to leave who you were behind and begin to think in terms of equations.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Is the MDP based on a rule base? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Human rule-based experience is useless in this process. Human thinking is often based on rules of cause and effect, for example. Furthermore, the MDP provides efficient alternatives to long consulting times with future users who cannot clearly express their problem.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Is the Q function based on the MDP? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. The use of the expression <em class="italics">Q</em> appeared around the time the Bellman equation, based on the MDP, came into fashion. It is more trendy to say you are using a Q function than to speak about Bellman, who put all of this together in 1957. The truth is that Andrey Markov was Russian and applied this method in 1913 using a dataset of 20,000 letters to predict the future use of letters in a novel. He then extended that to a dataset of 100,000 letters. This means that the theory was there 100 years ago. <em class="italics">Q</em> fits our new world of impersonal and powerful CPUs.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Is mathematics essential to AI? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. If you master the basics of linear algebra and probability, you will be on top of all the technology that is coming. It is worth spending a few months' worth of evenings on the subject or taking a MOOC. Otherwise, you will depend on others to explain things to you.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Can the Bellman-MDP process in this chapter apply to many problems? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. You can use this for robotics, market analysis, IoT, linguistics, and scores of other problems.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Is it impossible for a machine learning program to create another program by itself? (Yes| No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. It is not impossible. It has already been done by DeepCode: <a href="https://www.deepcode.ai/"><span class="url">https://www.deepcode.ai/</span></a>.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Do not be surprised. Now that you have become an adaptive thinker and know that these systems rely on equations, not humans, you can easily understand the fact that mathematical systems are not that difficult to reproduce.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Is a consultant required to enter business rules in a reinforcement learning program? (Yes| No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. It is only an option. Reinforcement learning in the MDP process is memoryless and random. Consultants are there to manage, explain, and train in these projects.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Is reinforcement learning supervised or unsupervised? (Supervised | Unsupervised)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">unsupervised</strong>. The whole point is to learn from unlabeled data. If the data is labeled, then we enter the world of supervised learning; that will be searching for patterns and learning them. At this point, you can easily see you are at sea in an adventure—a memoryless, random, and unlabeled world for you to discover.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Can Q-learning run without a reward matrix? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. A smart developer could always find a way around this, of course. The system requires a starting point. You will see in the second chapter that it is quite a task to find the right reward matrix in real-life projects.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-408" class="title">Chapter 2 – Building a Reward Matrix – Designing Your Datasets</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Raw data can be the input to a neuron and transformed with weights. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong> if the data is in numerical format. If it is in a proper numerical format, the input can be multiplied by the weights and biases.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">If the data is not in a numerical format, then it requires a numerical encoding phase.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Does a McCulloch-Pitts neuron require a threshold? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. Adding up weights does not mean much if you do not have something to measure the value. It took months of work for McCulloch and Pitt to put this together. At first, time was in the equation, just like it is in our brain. But then, like Joseph Fourier (1768-1830), they found cycles that repeated themselves—periods that did not require much more than that neuron.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts invented the first neuron and published a paper in 1943. Legend has it that at age 12 years in 1935, Walter Pitts, a poor child living in a bad neighborhood, was chased by bullies and sought refuge in a library. There, he discovered <em class="italics">Principia Mathematica</em>, by <em class="italics">Bertrand Russell</em> and <em class="italics">Alfred Whitehead</em>. Anyway, not only did he find mistakes in the reasoning, but he also sent a letter to Bertrand Russell! From then on, Walter was noted for his genius in mathematics. With Warren McCulloch, another genius, they invented the first neuron. It seems simple. But it's the result of a number of sleepless nights. Just as the invention of the wheel appears simple, nothing better has been found to this day. This concept of a neuron is the wheel of AI.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A logistic sigmoid activation function makes the sum of the weights larger. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. The whole point of a sigmoid function is to reduce the sums when necessary to have comparable numbers to work with.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A McCulloch-Pitts neuron sums the weights of its inputs. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. It's only when you sum the weights that they make sense.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A logistic sigmoid function is a log10 operation. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. The sigmoid function is based on Euler's number, <em class="italics">e</em>, a constant that is equal to 2.71828. This number produces a natural logarithm. Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) discovered this in the 18th century with a quill—no scientific calculator or computer! Did you notice that the main mathematical functions used in AI run far back in history? This aspect of the hype around what we think we have found now but has existed for decades, and sometimes centuries, will be dealt with in the following chapters.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A logistic softmax is not necessary if a logistic sigmoid function is applied to a vector. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Calculating the sum of several numbers of a vector and then dividing each number by that sum gives a view of the proportions involved. It is a precious tool to keep in mind.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A probability is a value between –1 and 1. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Probabilities lie between 0 and 1.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-409" class="title">Chapter 3 – Machine Intelligence – Evaluation Functions and Numerical Convergence</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Can a human beat a chess engine? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Today, the highest-level chess tournaments are not between humans but between chess engines. Each chess engine software editor prepares for these competitions by making their algorithms faster and requiring less CPU. Today, a top chess engine running on a smartphone can beat humans. In human-to-human chess competitions, the level of chess has reached very high limits of complexity. Humans now mostly train against machines.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Humans can estimate decisions better than machines with intuition when it comes to large volumes of data. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. The sheer CPU power of an average machine or even a smartphone can generate better results than humans with the proper algorithms.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Building a reinforcement learning program with a Q function is a feat in itself. Using the results afterward is useless. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. While learning AI, just verifying that the results are correct is enough. In real-life applications, the results are used in databases or as input to other systems.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Supervised learning decision tree functions can be used to verify that the result of the unsupervised learning process will produce reliable, predictable results. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. Decision tree functions are very efficient in many cases. When large volumes are involved, decision tree functions can be used to analyze the results of the machine learning process and contribute to a prediction process.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">The results of a reinforcement learning program can be used as input to a scheduling system by providing priorities. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. The output of reinforcement learning Q functions can be injected as input into another Q function. Several results can be consolidated in phase 1 and become the reward matrix of a phase 2 reinforcement learning session.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Can artificial intelligence software think like humans? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. In the early days, this was attempted with neuroscience-based models. However, applying mathematical models is presently far more efficient.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Who knows what will happen in future research with neuromorphic computing, for example? But for the time being, deep learning, the main trend, is based on mathematical functions.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-410" class="title">Chapter 4 – Optimizing Your Solutions with K-Means Clustering</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Can a prototype be built with random data in corporate environments? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. To start developing a prototype, using random data can help make sure that the basic algorithm works as planned.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">However, once the prototype is advanced, it will be more reliable to use a well-designed dataset. Then, once the training has been accomplished, random data can again help to see how your system behaves in all situations.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Do design matrices contain one example per matrix? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. A good design matrix contains one example in each row or each column depending on the shape you want it to have. But be careful; a design matrix that contains data that is too efficient might <em class="italics">overfit</em>. That means the learning algorithm will be efficient with that data but not adapt to new data. On the other hand, if the dataset contains too many errors, then the algorithm might <em class="italics">underfit</em>, meaning it won't learn correctly. A good design matrix should contain reliable data, some imprecise data, and some <em class="italics">noise</em> (some data that can influence the algorithm in unreliable ways).</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) can never be widespread. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. The sentence is not a correct assertion. AGVs will expand endlessly from now on: drones, cars, planes, warehouse vehicles, industrial vehicles, and more. AGVs, added to AI and IoT, constitute the fourth industrial revolution.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Can k-means clustering be applied to drone traffic? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. Seeing where traffic builds up will prevent drone jams (drones circling and waiting).</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Can k-means clustering be applied to forecasting? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. K-means clustering can be used for predictions.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Lloyd's algorithm is a two-step approach. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, Lloyd's algorithm first classifies each data point in the best cluster. Then, once that is done, it calculates the geometric center or centroid of that center. When no data point changes the cluster anymore, the algorithm has been trained.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Do hyperparameters control the behavior of the algorithm? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. Hyperparameters determine the course of the computation: the number of clusters, features, batch sizes, and more.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Once a program works, the way it is presented does not matter. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Without a clear presentation of the results, the whole training process is confusing at best and useless at worst.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">K-means clustering is only a classification algorithm. It's not a prediction algorithm. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. K-means clustering can be used as a prediction algorithm as well.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-411" class="title">Chapter 5 – How to Use Decision Trees to Enhance K-Means Clustering</h1>
    <p class="normal">The questions will focus on the hyperparameters.</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">The number of k clusters is not that important. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. The number of clusters requires careful selection, possibly a trial-and-error approach. Each project will lead to different clusters.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Mini-batches and batches contain the same amount of data. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. "Batch" generally refers to the dataset, and "mini-batch" represents a "subset" of data.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">K-means can run without mini-batches. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. If the volume of data remains small, then the training epochs can run on the whole dataset. If the data volume exceeds a reasonable amount of computer power (CPU or GPU), mini-batches must be created to optimize training computation.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Must centroids be optimized for result acceptance? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Suppose you want to put a key in a keyhole. The keyhole represents the centroid of your visual cluster. You must be precise. If you are simply throwing a piece of paper in your garbage can, you do not need to aim at the perfect center (centroid) of the cluster (marked by the rim of the garbage can) to attain that goal. Centroid precision depends on what is asked of the algorithm.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">It does not take long to optimize hyperparameters. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. If it's a simple project, it will not take long. If you are facing a large dataset, it will take some time to find the optimal hyperparameters.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">It sometimes takes weeks to train a large dataset. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. Media hype and hard work are two different worlds. Machine learning and deep learning are still tough projects to implement.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Decision trees and random forests are unsupervised algorithms. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Decision trees can both be used for supervised or unsupervised learning. Decision trees can start with a target value, which makes them supervised. Random forests can be used in the same way.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-412" class="title">Chapter 6 – Innovating AI with Google Translate</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Is it better to wait until you have a top-quality product before putting it on the market? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Context is everything. In the early 21st century, Airbus was struggling to complete the A380, the largest ever passenger airplane. Their engineers worked on hundreds of improvements before transporting commercial passengers. We would expect no less!</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">In the case of Google Translate, it is a massive no. By putting Google Translate online and providing an API, Google encouraged thousands of AI developers, linguists, consultants, and users to provide feedback and improvements. Furthermore, Google, once again, occupies a large share of the web market.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Considering the investment made, a new product should always be priced high to reach the top segment of the market. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong> and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Again, context determines the answer. When Ferrari puts a new car on the market, the price has to be high for two reasons; the quality of the car and the cost of production make it necessary to do so to make the innovation profitable. Also, Ferrari avoids mass production to keep its quality at high levels.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">When Amazon Web Services put machine learning on the market with SageMaker, it put a "pay-as-you-go" policy in place, starting at a very low end of the market. The product had, and has, its limits, but Amazon now receives tremendous volumes of feedback and is continuously improving the product.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Inventing a new solution will make it known in itself. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. An invention society is ready to accept will make its way on its own no matter what. You might be surprised to know that saving a camera's projected image by drawing it dates so far back in history that nobody knows for sure when it was first used. Nobody knows if it was invented or discovered. In any case, the first <em class="italics">camera obscura</em> (the first "cameras") was revolutionary. It is now proven that famous painters used the technique. The picture was projected on a paper or canvas. The "printer" was manual. The painter was the "printer." However, cameras, as we know, only became disruptive in the 20th century.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">AI can solve most problems without using standard non-learning algorithms. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Non-learning classical algorithms are necessary to create datasets, for example. Furthermore, AI relies on cloud servers, architectures, standard algorithms in all languages (C++, Java, Python, and others), and Apache servers. Even on a self-driving car, the sensors installed require standard hard work to get them working and interpreting information before AI comes in to solve some of the problems.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">AI is like our brain. Without a body, it cannot function.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Google Translate can satisfactorily translate all languages. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">After reading this chapter, you might be surprised to have a <strong class="bold">yes</strong> and <strong class="bold">no</strong> answer. If you are using Google Translate to say "hello," "how are you?", "thanks for the message," and similar friendly phrases on your favorite social network or in an email, it is good enough.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">But when dealing with more detailed phrases and sentences, Google Translate provides random satisfactory results. From a user's perspective, this is bad news. For a developer, it is a goldmine!</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">If you are not creative, it is no use trying to innovate. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is a massive <strong class="bold">no</strong>. You certainly do not need to be either imaginative or creative to innovate. Do not let anybody convince you of such nonsense. If you are designing a solution and find a missing component, look for some alternative components on the web, talk about it, and find people that can help. Then get it done through teamwork. This works every time!</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Even the great Bill Gates was smart enough to ask Tim Patterson for help to develop MS-DOS, and he went on to become a billionaire.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">If you are not a linguist, it is no use bothering with trying to improve Google Translate. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>! Once again, never let somebody convince you of such nonsense. Innovating is teamwork. If you like Google Translate and you understand this chapter and have ideas, team up with a linguist around you or through a social network. The world is yours to improve!</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Translating is too complicated to understand. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. The way some explain it is too complicated. If you speak a language, you are an expert in translating your thoughts into words. With work, you can get into the translation business.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">AI has already reached its limits. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Certainly <strong class="bold">not</strong>! We have just scratched the surface of both theory and applications.</p>
      </li>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-413" class="title">Chapter 7 – Optimizing Blockchains with Naive Bayes</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Cryptocurrency is the only use of blockchains today. (Yes | No)</strong>

      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Mining blockchains can be lucrative. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. But it is a risk, like any other mining operation or any speculative endeavor. Some companies have huge resources to mine cryptocurrency, meaning that they can beat smaller competitors in creating a block.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Blockchains for companies cannot be applied to sales. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Blockchain cloud platforms provide smart contracts and a secure way of managing transactions during a sales process.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Smart contracts for blockchains are more accessible to write than standard offline contracts. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, if they are standard contracts, this speeds the transaction up.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">On the other hand, <strong class="bold">no</strong>. If the transaction is complex and requires customization, a lawyer will have to write the contract, which can then only be used on a blockchain cloud platform.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong> and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. A block in a blockchain can never be changed again, thereby avoiding fraud. Nobody can tamper with the data. However, if the transaction is illegal in the first place, then the block will be fraudulent as well.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. There are many variations of Bayes' theorem. Using naive Bayes, for example, avoids the conditional probability constraint. But another approach could use conditional probability.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Training a naive Bayes dataset requires a standard function. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Gaussian functions, for example, can be used to calculate naive Bayes algorithms, among others.</p>
      </li>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-414" class="title">Chapter 8 – Solving the XOR Problem with a Feedforward Neural Network</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Can the perceptron alone solve the XOR problem? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. The answer would have been no in 1969. A neural network, or some other mathematical process, is necessary to solve this problem. For the record, this is a common problem for electric circuits that function with "feedforward" electricity, and was solved long ago.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Is the XOR function linearly non-separable? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong> if you use a single neuron, and <strong class="bold">yes</strong> if you use a hidden layer with at least two neurons. That is a major problem to address in deep learning. If you cannot separate the features of a face, for example, in a picture, recognizing that face will prove difficult. Imagine a picture with one half of the face in shadow and the other half in bright sunlight. Since the eye and features of one half are in shadow, a poor deep learning program might only capture half of the face, separating the face in the wrong place with a poor edge detection function. Linear separability is thus a key aspect of machine learning.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">One of the main goals of layers in a neural network is classification. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. Once the data is identifiable with a given neural network architecture, predictions and many other functions become possible. The key to deep learning is to be able to transform data into pieces of information that will make sense through the abstraction obtained over the layers.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Is deep learning the only way to classify data? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. You can classify data with a SQL query, spreadsheets, AI, machine learning, and standard source code. Deep learning becomes vital when many dimensions of classification are involved: first finding the edges of objects in a picture, then forms, and then determining what the object represents. To do this with millions of pictures is beyond the scope of standard programming or early AI and machine learning programs.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A cost function shows the increase in the cost of a neural network. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. A cost function determines how much the training costs you. Running 100,000 epochs is more expensive than running 50,000 epochs. So, at each epoch, the cost of training (how far the system is from its goal) must be estimated. Thus, a good cost function will decrease the cost of running a neural network.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Can simple arithmetic be enough to optimize a cost function? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. As long as you know to what extent your cost function is increasing or decreasing, anything that works is fine.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A feedforward network requires inputs, layers, and an output. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>. Without layers, there is no network.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A feedforward network always requires training with backpropagation. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is often <strong class="bold">yes</strong> in changing environments. Since the field is new, we tend to think that once the training is done, the work is done. If the datasets are very stable in a repetitive environment, such as recognizing the difference between various constant products in a shop, warehouse, or factory, then the neural network will do the classification it is designed for. If new products are introduced, then training can be initiated again.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">In real-life applications, solutions are only found by following existing theories. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Without academic research, deep learning would not even exist. Without universities, the ideas used would be so simple that they would never work well.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">On the other hand, researchers need real-life feedback. If we find new ways of doing things they recommend, we should publish them to help global research. It's a two-way street.</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-415" class="title">Chapter 9 – Abstract Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A convolutional neural network (CNN) can only process images. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. CNNs can process words, sounds, or video sequences, to classify and predict.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A kernel is a preset matrix used for convolutions. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. There are many preset matrices used to process images, such as the one used in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Edge_detection_Kernel.py</code> in this chapter. However, in this chapter, kernels were created randomly, and then the network trained their weights to fit the target images.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Does pooling have a pooling matrix, or is it random?</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">In some cases, a pooling matrix has a size that is an option when the pooling layer is added to the model, such as a 2×2 pooling window. However, in AutoML neural networks, for example, we can try to run optimizing algorithms that will test various sizes to see which one produces the best performance.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">The size of the dataset always has to be large. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. A dataset does not have a standard size. It depends on the training model. If the target images, for example, do not contain complex features, the dataset will be smaller than a complex feature dataset. Furthermore, the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ImageDataGenerator</code> function will expand the data by distorting it with the options provided.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Finding a dataset is not a problem with all the available image banks on the web. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Yes, because if the model remains a standard academic one, then the available images (CIFAR, MNIST, or others) will suffice.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">No, because in real-life corporate situations, you will have to build your dataset and add images containing <em class="italics">noise</em>. Noise requires more fine-tuning of the model to become reliable and generalized.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Once a CNN is built, training it does not take much time. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Whatever the model is, training will remain time-consuming if you want it to be reliable. As seen in this chapter, a model requires a lot of options and mathematical thinking.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A trained CNN model applies to only one type of image. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong> and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. There are three main types of overfitting:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Overfitting a model for a certain type of image with absolutely no consequence of implementation. In this case, the model classifies and predicts enough to satisfy the goals set. Suppose you are using a type of image with a very high definition. The CNN will detect the small details we may be trying to detect. However, when the application is in production, lower-quality images might make the model fail to identify what it had accurately detected with high-quality images.</li>
          <li class="Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Overfitting a model that creates implementation problems because it cannot adapt to different images at the same time. The model will then go through more training.</li>
          <li class="Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Overfitting a model that trains a certain type of image quite well but does not fit similar types of images when needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Each situation has its constraints. As long as the model works, no general rules apply. It is up to you to decide.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A quadratic loss function is not very efficient compared to a cross-entropy function. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">no</strong>. Each model has its constraints. Quadratic loss functions work fine on some models and do not provide good results on others. This represents the main problems of training a model. No general rules will help you. You have to use your neurons or write a program that modifies the model automatically.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">The performance of a deep learning CNN does not present a real issue with modern CPUs and GPUs. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is <strong class="bold">yes</strong>, and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. If the model runs quickly enough for your needs, then performance will not limit the outcome of your project. However, in many cases, it remains a problem. Reducing features to focus on the best ones is one of the reasons that the layers bring the size to analyze down, layer by layer.</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-416" class="title">Chapter 10 – Conceptual Representation Learning</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">The curse of dimensionality leads to reducing dimensions and features in machine learning algorithms. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. The volume of data and features makes it necessary to extract the main features of an observed event (an image, sound, and words) to make sense of it.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Overfitting and underfitting apply to dimensionality reduction as well. Reducing the features until the system works in a lab (overfitting) might lead to nowhere once the application faces real-life data. Trying to use all the features might lead to underfitting because the application solves no problem at all.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Regularization applies not just to data but to every aspect of a project.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Transfer learning determines the profitability of a project. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, if an application of an AI model in itself was unprofitable the first time, but could generate profit if used for a similar type of learning. Reusing some functions would generate profit, no doubt.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>, if the first application was extremely profitable but "overfitted" to meet the specifications of a given project.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Reading model.h5 does not provide much information. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. No in this case means that the assertion of the sentence is wrong. The saved model does provide useful information. Saving the weights of a TensorFlow model, for example, is vital during the training process to control the values. Furthermore, trained models often use HDF files (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.h5</code>) to load the trained weights. A Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) contains multidimensional arrays of scientific data.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Numbers without meaning are enough to replace humans. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, in the sense that in many cases, mathematics provides enough tools to replace humans for many tasks (games, optimization algorithms, and image recognition).</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>, in cases where mathematics cannot solve problems that require concepts, such as many aspects of NLP.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Chatbots prove that body language doesn't mean that much. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, in the sense that in many applications, body language does not provide additional information. If only a yes or no answer is required, body language will not add much to the conversation.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>, in the sense that if emotional intelligence is required to understand the tone of the user, a webcam detecting body language could provide useful information.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Present-day artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide enough theory to solve all AI requests. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) cannot solve thousands of problems, for example, translating poetry novels or recognizing images with forms that constantly vary.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Chatbots can now replace humans in all situations. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Concepts need to be added. The market provides all the necessary tools. It will take some years to be able to speak effectively with chatbots.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Self-driving cars have been approved and do not need conceptual training. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong> and <strong class="bold">no</strong>; there is some debate in this area. On the one hand, sensors and mathematics (linear algebra, probabilities) might succeed in effectively navigating roads in most driving conditions within a few years.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">However, certain problems will require concepts (and more robotics) in critical situations. If a self-driving car encounters a wounded person lying on the road, what is the best approach? The choices are to call for help, find another person if the help arrives too late, pick up the victim, drive them to a hospital (robotics), and much more.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Industries can implement AI algorithms for all of their needs. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong> and <strong class="bold">no</strong>. In many cases, all of the necessary tools are there to be used. If the right team decides to solve a problem with AI and robotics, it can be done.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">However, some tools are missing when it comes to addressing particular circumstances; for example, real-time management decision tools when faced with unplanned events. If a system breaks down, humans can still adapt faster to find alternative solutions to continue production.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. A CNN can classify images and make predictions.

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Planning describes the tasks that must be carried out. Scheduling adds a time factor. Planning tells us what to do, and scheduling tells us when.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Manufacturing clothing has been mastered by factories around the world. It would be a revolution if something in the process was entirely new. However, automation in the apparel industry has been around for 20+ years. The patent is a specialized case of elements that exist, like a new brand of car.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. With such a worldwide distribution, Amazon has come very close to the end user.

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Self-driving cars face the same difficulties as human-driven cars: getting to a location on time, respecting speed limits, or driving as safely as possible. Self-driving cars, like humans, are constantly improving their driving abilities through experience.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Yes. Sometimes, a self-driving car will perform better on a highway with little traffic.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">No. Sometimes, if the highways are dangerous (owing to weather conditions and heavy traffic), a self-driving car should take a safer road defined by slow speed and little to no traffic. This way, if difficulties occur, the self-driving car can slow down and even stop more easily than on a highway.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">Nobody can answer that question. As self-driving cars build their abilities and experience, they might well end up driving better than humans.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">In very unpredictable situations, humans can go off the road to avoid another car and back off a bit, for example. It will take more work to get a self-driving car to do that.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">One thing is certain, though. If a human is driving all night and falls asleep, the self-driving car will detect the head slumping movement, take over, and save lives.

Combining self-driving fire trucks with robots will certainly save many lives when a fire department faces difficult fires to extinguish.

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Communicating like a human means being human: having a body with body language, sensations, odors, fear hormones, and much more. Chatbots only emulate these behaviors.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Are chatbots necessarily AI programs? (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Many call centers use the "press 1, press 2 … press <em class="italics">n</em>" method, which requires careful organization but no AI.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Chatbots only need words to communicate. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer is not a clear-cut one.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. Simple chatbots can communicate with words in a controlled situation.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. When polysemy (several meanings for the same word or situation) is involved, pictograms and more add more efficient dimensions.</p>

      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Careful machine learning preparation is necessary to build a cognitive chatbot. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">The answer depends on the context.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. In limited "press 1 or press 2 " situations, chatbots can perform well with limited cognitive capacities.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. To engage in a real conversation with a human, mental images are the key to providing an empathetic exchange.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">For a chatbot to function, a dialog flow needs to be planned. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">This depends upon what you want your chatbot to do.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. It will provide better results in a business environment.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. If you want the chatbot to talk freely, you need to free it a bit. This still requires planning of the dialog, but it is more flexible.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">A chatbot possesses general AI, so no prior development is required. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. This is presently impossible. Only narrow (specific to one or a few fields) AI exists in real life, contrary to science fiction movies and media hype.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. That is what the best solution would be. To have an interactive chat service kick in.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. In many cases, it would be too expensive. A nice support screen could do the job and send an email to the support team.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. If it's an emergency bot, of course!</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. If the chatbot is there to perform a tedious administrative function, some degree of small talk will make the system more bearable.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. A genetic algorithm is random, which makes it more efficient than many deterministic algorithms.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">An evolutionary algorithm means that program code evolves. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">There is not a single clear-cut answer.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. The program runs like any other program.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. In some ways, when it is used to optimize a neural network in a hybrid neural network, it changes the parameters of the system. Also, it is possible to use a genetic algorithm to add or take layers out of a CNN, for example.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Certainly not! We need diverse genes to remain a fit genetic group.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Diversity makes the gene sets weaker. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. The greater the diversity, the richer the genetic pool is to adapt and remain fit.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">This depends on what you mean by "work."</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. Building a neural network only takes a few lines with TensorFlow 2.x, for example, and it will work.</p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. The neural network will work, but it will most probably not be efficient until its architecture and hyperparameters are fine-tuned.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Building a neural network with a genetic algorithm can help optimize the architecture of the layers. (Yes | No)</strong>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. That is the point. Neuromorphic begins with sub-symbolic low-level neuronal brain activity stimulations that do not form high-level mental activity yet. Our mental activity already uses symbols and contains representations in the form of words, images, numbers, and all kinds of constructions in general. </p>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-">However, we can say YES if we are referring to the output results translated into mental activity. My point is that yes and no answers limit our views of AI.</p>
      </li>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. That is the point! The core concept is to go from brain activity to structures formed by neuron spikes.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) is a hardware architecture. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Semantic pointers are like computer program pointers such as C++ pointers. The difference is that they carry a partial meaning of representation to come, hence the word "semantic."</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Not at all! Loihi is an Intel neurocomputing chip containing a massive number of neurons. A human brain contains around 100 billion neurons. Imagine that, soon, you'll have a network of neurocomputing chips (Intel or other) that attain that number. Then imagine what can be done with semantic pointers through neurocomputing.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. But the question was tricky! Basically, Nengo uses a non-symbolic approach as discussed at length previously. However, it contains Python tutorials with many algorithms solved through neurocomputing, forming a complete problem-solving package.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Spiking blocks neuronal activity. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. But again, this is a tricky question. Spiking is reflected in the level of activity in a neuron. So, in that respect, the answer is no. But a spiking neuron can inhibit another neuron, thereby blocking it indirectly.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Firing patterns can be used to analyze brain activity. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. Firing patterns change in time in neurocomputing, providing useful information on how the neurons reach a given state.</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Yes</strong>. True. Mathematics alone cannot replace deep thinking. Even if computers have incredible power and can beat human players at chess, for example, they still cannot adapt to new situations without going through a design and training process. Concepts need to be added and experienced (memory as well).</p>

        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. False. IBM, for example, can swap the quantum from score to a QASM interface or display both, as shown here:</p>

      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Quantum simulators can run as fast as quantum computers. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. Certainly not! A simulator shows how a quantum score would behave on a real quantum computer. Although the simulator can help build the score, a quantum computer will run exponentially faster than the simulator.</p>

      <li class="list"><strong class="bold">Quantum computers produce intermediate results when they are running calculations. (Yes | No)</strong>
        <p class="Bullet-Without-Bullet-Within-Bullet--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">No</strong>. This is not possible. The qubits are too unstable. Observing them makes the system collapse. However, simulators such as Quirk come in handy. Since they are not real, intermediate results can be displayed to design a quantum score.</p>
