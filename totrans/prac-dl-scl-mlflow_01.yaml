    of **deep learning** (**DL**), and understand the emerging field of **machine
    learning operations** (**MLOps**) and the role of MLflow. We will provide an overview
    of the challenges in the four pillars of a DL process: data, model, code, and
    explainability. Then, we will learn how to set up a basic local MLflow development
    environment and run our first MLflow experiment for a **natural language processing**
    (**NLP**) model built on top of **PyTorch Lightning Flash**. Finally, we will
    explain the foundational MLflow concepts such as experiments, runs, and many more,
    through this first MLflow experiment example.'
