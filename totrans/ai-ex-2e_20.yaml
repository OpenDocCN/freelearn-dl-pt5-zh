  id: totrans-2
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer is **yes**. Reinforcement learning is memoryless. The agent calculates
    the next state without looking into the past. This is significantly different
    from humans. Humans rely heavily on memory. A CPU-based reinforcement learning
    system finds solutions without experience. Human intelligence merely proves that
    intelligence can solve a problem. No more, no less. An adaptive thinker can then
    imagine new forms of machine intelligence.

    choices are random. In just two questions, you can see that the Bellman equation
    is memoryless and makes random decisions. No human reasons like that. Being an
    adaptive thinker is a leap of faith. You have to leave who you were behind and
    begin to think in terms of equations.

    the Bellman equation, based on the MDP, came into fashion. It is more trendy to
    say you are using a Q function than to speak about Bellman, who put all of this
    together in 1957\. The truth is that Andrey Markov was Russian and applied this
    method in 1913 using a dataset of 20,000 letters to predict the future use of
    letters in a novel. He then extended that to a dataset of 100,000 letters. This
    means that the theory was there 100 years ago. *Q* fits our new world of impersonal
    and powerful CPUs.

    child living in a bad neighborhood, was chased by bullies and sought refuge in
    a library. There, he discovered *Principia Mathematica*, by *Bertrand Russell*
    and *Alfred Whitehead*. Anyway, not only did he find mistakes in the reasoning,
    but he also sent a letter to Bertrand Russell! From then on, Walter was noted
    for his genius in mathematics. With Warren McCulloch, another genius, they invented
    the first neuron. It seems simple. But it's the result of a number of sleepless
    nights. Just as the invention of the wheel appears simple, nothing better has
