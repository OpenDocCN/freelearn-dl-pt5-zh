- en: New experiences can be intimidating, but not this one! This beginner's guide
    to deep learning is here to help you explore deep learning from scratch with Keras,
    and be on your way to training your first ever neural networks.

- en: What sets Keras apart from other deep learning frameworks is its simplicity.
    With over two hundred thousand users, Keras has a stronger adoption in industry
    and the research community than any other deep learning framework.

- en: '*The Deep Learning with Keras Workshop* starts by introducing you to the fundamental
    concepts of machine learning using the scikit-learn package. After learning how
    to perform the linear transformations that are necessary for building neural networks,
    you''ll build your first neural network with the Keras library. As you advance,
    you''ll learn how to build multi-layer neural networks and recognize when your
    model is underfitting or overfitting to the training data. With the help of practical
    exercises, you''ll learn to use cross-validation techniques to evaluate your models
    and then choose the optimal hyperparameters to fine tune their performance. Finally,
    you''ll explore recurrent neural networks and learn how to train them to predict
    values in sequential data.'

- en: If you know the basics of data science and machine learning and want to get
    started with advanced machine learning technologies like artificial neural networks
    and deep learning, then this is the book for you. To grasp the concepts explained
    in this deep learning book more effectively, prior experience in Python programming
    and some familiarity with statistics and logistic regression are a must.

- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Introduction to Machine Learning with Keras*, will introduce
    you to the fundamental concepts of machine learning by using the scikit-learn
    package. You will learn how to present data for model building, then train a logistic
    regression model using a real-world dataset.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Machine Learning versus Deep Learning*, will present the difference
    between traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms.
    You will learn the linear transformations necessary for building neural networks
    and build your first neural network with the Keras library.'

    network building. You will learn how to build multi-layer neural networks and
    recognize when your model is underfitting or overfitting to the training data.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4,* *Evaluating Your Model with Cross-Validation Using Keras Wrappers*,
    will teach you how to use Keras wrappers with scikit-learn to incorporate Keras
    models into a scikit-learn workflow. You will apply cross-validation to evaluate
    your models and use this technique to choose the optimal hyperparameters.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Improving Model Accuracy*, will introduce various regularization
    techniques to prevent your models from overfitting to the training data. You will
    learn different methods to search for the optimal hyperparameters that result
    in the highest model accuracy.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Model Evaluation*, will demonstrate a variety of methods to evaluate
    your models. Beyond accuracy, you will learn more model evaluation metrics including
    sensitivity, specificity, precision, false positive rate, ROC curves, and AUC
    scores to understand how well your models perform.'

- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Computer Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks*, will introduce
    you to building image classifiers with convolutional neural networks. You will
    learn about all the components that comprise the architecture of convolutional
    neural networks and then build image processing applications to classify images.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Transfer Learning and Pre-Trained Models*, will introduce you
    to the concept of transferring the learning from one model to solve for other
    applications. You will achieve this by using different pre-trained models and
    modifying them slightly to fit different applications.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Sequential Modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks*, will teach
    you how to build models with sequential data. You will learn the architecture
    of recurrent neural networks and how to train them to predict the succeeding values
    from sequential data. You will test your knowledge by predicting the future values
    of various stock prices.'
