- en: Have you ever wondered why so many machine learning projects fail in production?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In many cases, this is because of a lack of generalization of models, leading
    to unexpected predictions when facing new, unseen data. This is what regularization
    is about: making sure a model provides the expected predictions, even when facing
    new data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In this book, we will explore many forms of regularization. To accomplish this,
    we will explore two primary avenues for regularization solutions, depending on
    the recipes in the chapter:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When given a machine learning model, how do we regularize it? Regularizing is
    most suited in applications where the model is already imposed (whether there
    is a legacy solution to be updated or strong requirements) and the training data
    is fixed, so the only solution is to regularize the model.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given a machine learning task, how do we get a robust, well-generalizing solution?
    This approach is most suited in applications where only the problem is defined,
    but no strong constraints have been provided yet, so more solutions can be explored.

  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hopefully, these recipes will provide you with the necessary tools and techniques
    to solve most of the machine learning problems you may face that require regularization,
    as well as a solid practical understanding of the underlying concepts.

- en: 'This book is suitable for anyone with prior Python knowledge: the only strong
    requirement to fully understand the proposed solutions is that you can read and
    run simple Python code. For each new method or model that is introduced, some
    context and practical explanations are provided, so that anyone with a computer
    science background can fully understand what they are doing.'

    audience is the following:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine learning practitioners, such as machine learning engineers, applied
    scientists, and data scientists, who want ready-to-use methods and code to pick
    from whenever they face a new problem or task. Using this book, hopefully they
    can handle many situations by slightly adapting the code to their own problems.

    of machine learning, with concrete examples and working code. Using this book,
