    language so that computer systems can further process it to perform useful applications.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developers will find that this practical guide enables them to use NLU techniques
    to develop many kinds of NLU applications, and managers will be able to identify
    areas where NLU can be applied to solve real problems in their enterprises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts and practical
    examples, you will begin by learning what NLU is and how it can be applied. You
    will then learn about the wide range of current NLU techniques, and you will learn
    about the best situations to apply each one, including the new **large language
    models** (**LLMs**). In the process, you will be introduced to the most useful
    Python NLU libraries. Not only will you learn the basics of NLU, but you will
    also learn about many practical issues such as acquiring data, evaluating systems,
    improving your system’s results, and deploying NLU applications. Most importantly,
    you will not just learn a rote list of techniques, but you will learn how to take
    advantage of the vast number of NLU resources on the web in your future work.
