			<p>New experiences can be intimidating, but not this one! This beginner's guide to deep learning is here to help you explore deep learning from scratch with Keras, and be on your way to training your first ever neural networks. </p>
			<p>What sets Keras apart from other deep learning frameworks is its simplicity. With over two hundred thousand users, Keras has a stronger adoption in industry and the research community than any other deep learning framework. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">The Deep Learning with Keras Workshop</em> starts by introducing you to the fundamental concepts of machine learning using the scikit-learn package. After learning how to perform the linear transformations that are necessary for building neural networks, you'll build your first neural network with the Keras library. As you advance, you'll learn how to build multi-layer neural networks and recognize when your model is underfitting or overfitting to the training data. With the help of practical exercises, you'll learn to use cross-validation techniques to evaluate your models and then choose the optimal hyperparameters to fine tune their performance. Finally, you'll explore recurrent neural networks and learn how to train them to predict values in sequential data. </p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you'll have developed the skills you need to confidently train your own neural network models.</p>

			<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, path names, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows:</p>
			<p>"<strong class="source-inline">sklearn</strong> has a class called <strong class="source-inline">train_test_split</strong>, which provides the functionality for splitting data."</p>
			<p>Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, also appear in the same format.</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code"># import libraries</p>
			<p class="source-code">import pandas as pd</p>
			<p class="source-code">from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split</p>
			<p>New terms and important words are shown like this: </p>
			<p>"A dictionary contains multiple elements, like a <strong class="bold">list</strong>, but each element is organized as a key-value pair."</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Code Presentation</h2>
			<p>Lines of code that span multiple lines are split using a backslash ( <strong class="source-inline">\</strong> ). When the code is executed, Python will ignore the backslash, and treat the code on the next line as a direct continuation of the current line.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=5, verbose=1, \</p>
			<p class="source-code">                   validation_split=0.2, shuffle=False)</p>
			<p>Comments are added into code to help explain specific bits of logic. Single-line comments are denoted using the <strong class="source-inline">#</strong> symbol, as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code"># Print the sizes of the dataset</p>
			<p class="source-code">print("Number of Examples in the Dataset = ", X.shape[0])</p>
			<p class="source-code">print("Number of Features for each example = ", X.shape[1])</p>
			<p>Multi-line comments are enclosed by triple quotes, as shown below:</p>
			<p class="source-code">"""</p>
			<p class="source-code">Define a seed for the random number generator to ensure the </p>
			<p class="source-code">result will be reproducible</p>
			<p class="source-code">"""</p>
			<p class="source-code">seed = 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">np.random.seed(seed)</p>
			<p class="source-code">random.set_seed(seed)</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Setting up Your Environment</h2>
			<p>Before we explore the book in detail, we need to set up specific software and tools. In the following section, we shall see how to do that.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Installing Anaconda</h2>
			<p>For this course, we will use Anaconda; a Python distribution which comes with an in-built package manager and pre-installed packages frequently used for machine learning and scientific computing,</p>
			<p>To install Anaconda, find your desired version (Windows, macOS, or Linux) on the official installation page at <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/</a>. Follow the appropriate installation instructions for your operating system.</p>
			<p>Once Anaconda is installed, you can interact with it via the Anaconda Navigator or Anaconda Prompt. There are instructions on how to use these at <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/">https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/</a>.</p>
			<p>To verify the correct installation, you can execute the <strong class="source-inline">anaconda-navigator</strong> command on CMD / Terminal. If the installation is correct, this will open up the Anaconda Navigator.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Installing Libraries</h2>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">pip</strong> comes pre-installed with Anaconda. Once Anaconda is installed on your machine, all the required libraries can be installed using <strong class="source-inline">pip</strong>, for example, <strong class="source-inline">pip install numpy</strong>. Alternatively, you can install all the required libraries using <strong class="source-inline">pip install –r requirements.txt</strong>. You can find the <strong class="source-inline">requirements.txt</strong> file at <a href="https://packt.live/3hhZ2v9">https://packt.live/3hhZ2v9</a>.</p>
			<p>The exercises and activities will be executed in Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter is a Python library and can be installed in the same way as the other Python libraries – that is, with <strong class="source-inline">pip install jupyter</strong>, but fortunately, it comes pre-installed with Anaconda.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Running Jupyter Notebook </h2>
			<p>You can start Jupyter via the appropriate link in the Anaconda Navigator, or by executing the command <strong class="source-inline">jupyter notebook</strong> in Anaconda Prompt / CMD / Terminal.</p>
			<p>Jupyter will open up in your browser, where you will then be able to navigate to your working directory and create, edit and run your code files.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Accessing the Code Files</h2>
			<p>You can find the complete code files of this book at <a href="https://packt.live/2OL5E9t">https://packt.live/2OL5E9t</a>. You can also run many activities and exercises directly in your web browser by using the interactive lab environment at <a href="https://packt.live/2CXyFLS">https://packt.live/2CXyFLS</a>.</p>
			<p>We've tried to support interactive versions of all activities and exercises, but we recommend a local installation as well for instances where this support isn't available.</p>
			<p>The high-quality color images used in the book can found at <a href="https://packt.live/2u9Tno4">https://packt.live/2u9Tno4</a>.</p>
