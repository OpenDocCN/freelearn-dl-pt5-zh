- en: Over the last decade, the field of machine learning has taken great strides,
    and in so doing has captured the public’s imagination. But it’s crucial to remember
    that – as impressive as these algorithms are – they are not infallible. Through
    this book, we hope to provide an approachable introduction to how Bayesian inference
    can be leveraged within deep learning, giving the reader the tools to develop
    models that ”know when they don’t know.” In so doing, you’ll be able to develop
    more robust deep learning systems better suited to the demands of today’s machine
    learning-based applications.

    as well as some familiarity with concepts around Bayesian inference. Some practical
    knowledge of working with Python and a machine learning framework such as TensorFlow
    or PyTorch would also be valuable but is not necessary.
