			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Natural language understanding</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLU</strong>) is a technology that structures language so that computer systems can further process it to perform <span class="No-Break">useful applications.</span></p>
			<p>Developers will find that this practical guide enables them to use NLU techniques to develop many kinds of NLU applications, and managers will be able to identify areas where NLU can be applied to solve real problems in <span class="No-Break">their enterprises.</span></p>
			<p>Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts and practical examples, you will begin by learning what NLU is and how it can be applied. You will then learn about the wide range of current NLU techniques, and you will learn about the best situations to apply each one, including the new <strong class="bold">large language models</strong> (<strong class="bold">LLMs</strong>). In the process, you will be introduced to the most useful Python NLU libraries. Not only will you learn the basics of NLU, but you will also learn about many practical issues such as acquiring data, evaluating systems, improving your system’s results, and deploying NLU applications. Most importantly, you will not just learn a rote list of techniques, but you will learn how to take advantage of the vast number of NLU resources on the web in your <span class="No-Break">future work.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>Python developers who are interested in learning about NLU and applying <strong class="bold">natural language processing</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLP</strong>) technology to real problems will get the most from this book, including computational linguists, linguists, data scientists, NLP developers, conversational AI developers, and students of these topics. The earlier chapters will also be interesting for non-technical <span class="No-Break">project managers.</span></p>
			<p>Working knowledge of Python is required to get the best from this book. You do not need any previous knowledge <span class="No-Break">of NLU.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p>This book includes fifteen chapters that will take you through a process that starts from understanding what NLU is, through selecting applications, developing systems, and figuring out how to improve a system you <span class="No-Break">have developed.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>The code for this book is provided in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. To run the notebooks, you should have a comfortable understanding of coding in Python and be familiar with some basic libraries. Additionally, you’ll need to install the <span class="No-Break">required packages.</span></p>
			<p>The easiest way to install them is by using Pip, a great package manager for Python. If Pip is not yet installed on your system, you can find the installation instructions <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/"><span class="No-Break">https://pypi.org/project/pip/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Working knowledge of the Python programming language will assist with understanding the key concepts covered in this book. The examples in this book don’t require GPUs and can run on CPUs, although some of the more complex machine learning examples would run faster on a computer with <span class="No-Break">a GPU.</span></p>
			<p>The code for this book has <em class="italic">only been</em> <em class="italic">tested on Windows </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">11</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (64-bit).</span></p>
