- en: In this section, we will learn how to use MLflow to track **deep learning**
    (**DL**) pipelines to answer various provenance-tracking questions related to
    data, model, and code (including both notebook and pipeline code). We will start
    with setting up a local full-fledged MLflow tracking server that will be used
    frequently in the rest of this book. A provenance tracking framework that includes
    six types of provenance questions will be presented to guide our implementation.
    Then, we will learn how to track model provenance, metrics, and parameters using
    MLflow to answer these provenance questions. We will also learn how to choose
    an appropriate notebook and pipeline framework to implement DL code that's extensible
    and trackable. We will then implement a multi-step DL training/testing/registration
    pipeline using MLflow's **MLproject**. Finally, we will learn how to track public
    and privately built Python libraries and data versioning using **Delta Lake**.
