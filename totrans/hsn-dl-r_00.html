<p>Deep learning enables efficient and accurate learning from massive amounts of data. Deep learning is being adopted by numerous industries at an increasing pace since it can help solve a number of challenges that cannot easily be solved by means of traditional machine learning techniques. </p>
<p>Developers working with R will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide to deep learning. This book provides a hands-on approach to implementation and associated methodologies that will have you up and running and productive in no time. Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts and practical examples, you will begin by exploring deep learning in general, including an overview of deep learning advantages and architecture. You will explore the architecture of various deep learning algorithms and understand their applicable fields. You will also learn how to build deep learning models, optimize hyperparameters, and evaluate model performance. </p>
<p>By the end of this book, you will be able to build and deploy your own deep learning models and applications using deep learning frameworks and algorithms <span>specific to your problem. </span></p>

<p><a href="060f9969-6a4b-4a31-87f4-5ba428213d70.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Machine Learning Basics</em>, reviews all the essential elements of machine learning. This quick refresher is important as we move into deep learning, a subset of machine learning, which shares a number of common terms and methods.</p>
<p><a href="c83f30b5-3cd2-4415-9936-2749a48ec92d.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>,<span> <em>Setting Up R for Deep Learning</em></span><span>, summarizes the common frameworks and algorithms for deep learning and reinforced deep learning in R. You will become familiar with the common libraries, including MXNet, H2O, and Keras, and learn how to install each library in R.</span></p>
<p><a href="f3ab4bb2-a4d5-4e2d-9ed1-ea2e165322d0.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>,<span> <em>Artificial Neural Networks</em>,</span><span> teaches you about artificial neural networks, which make up the base building block for all deep learning. You will build a simple artificial neural network and learn how all of its components combine to solve complex problems.</span></p>
<p><a href="b614d2ff-1494-4a53-bd21-3c5d108be87c.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <span><em>CNNs for Image Recognition</em>,</span><span> demonstrates how to use convolutional neural networks for image recognition. We will briefly cover why these deep learning networks are superior to shallow nets. The remainder of the chapter will cover the components of a convolutional neural network with considerations for making the most appropriate choice.</span></p>
<p><a href="28bcc5fe-c39e-4052-bd8e-3a65e31786bf.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>,<span> <em>Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks for Signal Detection</em>,</span><span> shows how to build a multilayer perceptron neural network for signal detection. You will learn the architecture of multilayer perceptron neural networks, and also learn how to prepare data, define hidden layers and neurons, and train a model using a backpropagation algorithm in R.</span></p>
<p><a href="465e7644-999d-4eae-ad75-b0c7e42cb11b.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <span><em>Neural Collaborative Filtering Using Embeddings</em></span><span>, explains how to build a neural collaborative filtering recommender system using layered embeddings. You will learn how to use the custom Keras API, construct an architecture with user-item embedding layers, and train a practical recommender system using implicit ratings. </span></p>
<p><a href="a000fdb8-7d3e-436b-abd9-9fbc9b3c33f0.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>,<span> <em>Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing</em>,</span><span> explains how to create document summaries. The chapter begins with removing parts of documents that should not be considered and tokenizing the remaining text. Afterward, embeddings are applied and clusters are created. These clusters are then used to make document summaries. We will also learn to code a <strong>Restricted Boltzmann Machine</strong> (<strong>RBM</strong>) along with defining Gibbs Sampling, Contrastive Divergence, and Free Energy for the algorithm. The chapter will conclude with compiling multiple RBMs to create a deep belief network.</span></p>
<p><a href="78ca8218-f112-47fc-bd1f-4bd451982b64.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>,<span> <em>Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Stock Forecasting</em>,</span><span> shows how to use <strong>long short-term memory</strong> (<strong>LSTM</strong>) RNN networks for predictive analytics. You will learn how to prepare sequence data for LSTM and how to build a predictive model with LSTM.</span></p>
<p><a href="eaf78915-de7f-4db5-a9a9-d5dc4f729a61.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>,<span> <em>Generative Adversarial Networks for Faces</em>,</span><span> describes the main components and applications of <strong>generative adversarial networks</strong> (<strong>GANs</strong>).

You will learn the concept and implementation of reinforcement learning in a highly customizable framework. Moreover, you will also learn how to create an agent that plays the best action for each game step and how to implement reinforcement learning in R.</span></p>
<p><a href="24ecb25d-640d-4906-acdc-2ab333b0cddd.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>,<span> <em>Deep Q-Learning for Maze Solving</em>,</span><span> shows us how to use R to implement reinforcement learning techniques within a maze environment. In particular, we will create an agent to solve a maze by training an agent to perform actions and to learn from failed attempts.</span></p>

<p>We assume you are comfortable and have a working familiarity with downloading and installing software on your computer, including R and additional R library packages from CRAN or GitHub. We also assume some baseline familiarity with independently troubleshooting and resolving packaging dependencies (as needed) based on R Studio console output. You will need a version of R and R Studio installed on your computer—the latest version, if possible.</p>
<p>All code examples have been tested using R version 3.6.3 on macOS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and higher. This code should work with future version releases, too, although this may require some of the deep learning R software packages listed in <a href="c83f30b5-3cd2-4415-9936-2749a48ec92d.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <span><em>Setting Up R for Deep Learning</em></span><span>,</span> to be updated.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>:<span> </span><span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles.<span> </span><span>Here is an example:</span><span> </span>"<span>The </span><kbd>linear_fits</kbd><span> function is then used again to draw one more line.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>linear_fits &lt;- function(w, to_add = TRUE, line_type = 1) {curve(-w[1] / w[2] * x - w[3] / w[2], xlim = c(-1, 2), ylim = c(-1, 2), col = "black",lty = line_type, lwd = 2, xlab = "Input Value A", ylab = "Input Value B", add = to_add)}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>results &lt;- softmax(c(2,3,6,9))<br/>results<br/><br/><strong>[1] 0.0008658387 0.0023535935 0.0472731888 0.9495073791</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "One potential problem with ReLU is known as <strong>dying ReLU</strong>, where, since the function assigns a zero value to all negative values, signals can get dropped completely before reaching the output node.</span><span>"</span></p>
