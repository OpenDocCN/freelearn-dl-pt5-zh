    <h1 id="_idParaDest-382" class="chapterTitle">Quantum Computing</h1>
    <p class="normal">IBM has begun to build quantum computers for research and business purposes. In a few years, quantum computing will become disruptive and will provide exponential computing power. Google, Xanadu, D-Wave, Rigetti, and others devote research budgets to quantum computing.</p>
    <p class="normal">This unique computer capacity in the history of humanity opens the doors to obtaining results that would be impossible to obtain with classical computers. In 1994, Peter Shor showed that a quantum algorithm could perform better than a classical one for prime factors of an integer and the discrete logarithm problem. Then in 1995, Lov Grover added the unstructured search problem. With the rise of quantum computers, research can go much further.</p>
    <p class="normal">Quantum computers in themselves will not provide revolutionary algorithms. Any algorithm can be broken down into components that run basic classical machines. Supercomputers can still run artificial intelligence algorithms much easier than implementing them with quantum computers. Quantum computers have no memory, for example, so they rely heavily on classical computers for the input and interpreting the output.</p>
    <p class="normal">Though quantum computers have limits, in time, quantum computing power will take present-day algorithms beyond the limits of our imagination. Many corporations have invested in quantum computing research in the fields of banking, healthcare, cybersecurity and more.</p>
    <p class="normal">This chapter explains why quantum computers are superior to classical computers, what a quantum bit is, how to use it, and how the quantum mind experiment could lead to a quantum thinking machine. The example provided is simply a recreative way to approach quantum computing. </p>
    <p class="normal">We will be taking results from a classical machine, feed the results to quantum computer and then interpret the results provided by the quantum computing algorithm. Some go further with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which is beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="italics">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italics">Neuromorphic Computing</em>, we explored how to use our brain to create neuromorphic models. In this chapter, we will create a higher level of representation with a research project to create a mind. Quantum mind is based on CRLMM, which I have been successfully applying to many corporate sites. In this research project, a quantum mind named MindX represents the mind of a random person. We will explore MindX in an exciting experiment.</p>
    <p class="normal">The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Why quantum computers are more powerful than other classical computers</li>
      <li class="list">What a quantum bit is</li>
      <li class="list">The Bloch sphere</li>
      <li class="list">Quantum computing</li>
      <li class="list">How to build MindX, a thinking quantum computer research project</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">First, let's discuss some basics behind quantum computers, and what makes them so powerful.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-"><strong class="bold">Note</strong>: This chapter is self-contained with screenshots of quantum circuits for those who do not wish to install anything before reading the chapter. IBM Q and Quirk can be used online without installing anything locally.</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-383" class="title">The rising power of quantum computers</h1>
    <p class="normal">Before we begin discussing MindX, an <a id="_idIndexMarker914"/>exciting research project to create a thinking quantum computer, we should start with the fundamentals. This section describes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Why quantum computers are faster</li>
      <li class="list">What a qubit is</li>
      <li class="list">How a qubit is measured (its position)</li>
      <li class="list">How to create a quantum score (program) with quantum gates</li>
      <li class="list">How to run a quantum score and use its results for a cognitive NLP chatbot</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The goal of this chapter is not to go too deeply into the details of quantum computing, but rather to teach you enough to know how to build a thinking quantum computer. This chapter is simply meant to show how a quantum computer works and open ourselves to new ways to use computers.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-384" class="title">Quantum computer speed</h2>
    <p class="normal">A standard<a id="_idIndexMarker915"/> computer bit has a 0 or a 1 state. A classical computer will manage 0 or 1, as the system chooses, but it remains limited to choosing 1 or (XOR) 0. It cannot manage both states at the same time.</p>
    <p class="normal">A quantum computer is not constrained by an XOR state. It is an AND state. It can manage values between 0 and 1 at the same time until it is measured! A quantum state is unknown until it's observed, which means that a quantum program can use values between 0 and 1 at the same time. Once observed, the qubit will take a value of 0 or 1 because of the physical instability of a quantum state.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Just observing a quantum<a id="_idIndexMarker916"/> state makes the state break down. In quantum computing, this is called <strong class="bold">decoherence</strong>. It is not magic. Qubits are unstable. When observed, the quantum state breaks down.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">This means quantum computing is memoryless once it is measured. Storage does not exist in a quantum computer. The input is made by a classical computer, and the output goes back to a classical computer, to be stored through the following process:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="list">A classical computer provides an input</li>
      <li class="list">A quantum computer processes the input and produces an output</li>
      <li class="list">A classical computer interprets the output</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="normal">That being said, the computing power of a quantum computer fully justifies this architectural constraint.</p>
    <p class="normal">Until a qubit is observed, it can have a 0 or 1 state or a probability in between, such as 0.1, 0.7, or 0.9.</p>
    <p class="normal">Observing the situation is called measuring the state. When measured, only 0 or (XOR) 1 will become the result.</p>
    <p class="normal">Until the state is measured, a large number of probabilities are possible. If a qubit is added to the system, we now have two qubits and four elementary combinations all at the same time.</p>
    <p class="normal">Unlike standard computer logic, all four of the states can be used to compute algorithms at the same time in a parallel process. The volume of the possible states of a given algorithm will thus expand with the number of qubits involved. An estimation of the volume of the states can be made with the following number, in which <em class="italics">q</em> is the number of qubits:</p>
    <p class="center">2<sup style="font-style: italic;">q</sup></p>
    <p class="normal">Looking at this tiny equation does not seem awesome at all. Now, let's see what it looks like in a loop that runs up to 100 qubits with the number, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">nb</code>, of possible states:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><code class="hljs pgsql"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> numpy <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> np

    v=(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>**q)
    print("Size of nb to describe",q," qubits:","{:,}".format(v))

    <p class="normal">The program does not appear fearsome either. However, the following output is awesome:</p>

</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Presently, big data is <a id="_idIndexMarker917"/>often calculated in petabytes. A petabyte=10<sup>15</sup> or about 2<sup>50</sup> bytes.</p>
    <p class="normal">Facebook stores data for over 2 billion accounts. Imagine Facebook managing 500 petabytes on a given day. Let's see what 500 petabytes approximately add up to in the following code:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><code class="hljs lisp">print(<span class="hljs-string">"Facebook in the near future:"</span>)
s=(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>**<span class="hljs-number">50</span>)*500
print(<span class="hljs-string">"{:,}"</span>.format(<span class="hljs-name">v</span>))
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The output is quite surprising because it is about the size of data a 100-qubit quantum computer can compute in one run:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><code class="hljs angelscript">A segment of Facebook data :
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">267</span>,<span class="hljs-number">650</span>,<span class="hljs-number">600</span>,<span class="hljs-number">228</span>,<span class="hljs-number">229</span>,<span class="hljs-number">401</span>,<span class="hljs-number">496</span>,<span class="hljs-number">703</span>,<span class="hljs-number">205</span>,<span class="hljs-number">376</span>
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This means that a single quantum computer with 100 qubits can run a calculation of the size of all the data that over 2,000,000,000 Facebook accounts might represent in the near future.</p>
    <p class="normal">A quantum computer would not actually contain that volume of data at all, but it shows that one could produce a calculation with that volume of computation information.</p>
    <p class="normal">More importantly, this also means that a single quantum computer can run a mind-dataset of a single mind (see the next section) and calculate associations. This thinking process can generate an exponential volume of connections.</p>
    <p class="normal">A classical <em class="italics">n</em>-bit computer manages <em class="italics">n</em> bits whereas a quantum computer will manage 2<sup style="font-style: italic;">n</sup> bits or 2<sup style="font-style: italic;">q</sup> bits.</p>
    <p class="normal">Compared to<a id="_idIndexMarker918"/> quantum computers' 2<sup style="font-style: italic;">q</sup> exponential power, soon, classical computers will seem like relics of the past for scientific calculations. Classical computers will still be in use, but quantum computers will be the tools with which to explore the world beyond the present limits of artificial intelligence.</p>
    <div class="packt_tip">
      <p>Visualize all the AI solutions you have seen in this book. They will already seem to have some dust of the past on them once you get your hands on quantum computing.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Quantum computers will beat any other computer in many fields in the years to come. In one parallel computation, a quantum computer will do in one run something that it would take a classical computer years to calculate.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now think about what a network of many quantum computers could do!</p>
    <p class="normal">Often, we try to compare large volumes with the number of stars in the universe and we say, "That's more than the number of stars in our universe." We must now look in the opposite direction, at very small numbers.</p>
    <p class="normal">The lesson is clear: the future lies in nano models. Quantum computing represents both a challenge and an opportunity.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-385" class="title">Defining a qubit</h2>
    <p class="normal">A qubit, a quantum bit, has a <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>physical counterpart. For example, a quantum state can be encoded in oscillating currents with superconductor loops. Google and IBM have experimented with this approach. Another way is to encode a qubit in an ion trapped in an electromagnetic field in a vacuum trap.</p>
    <p class="normal">Photons, electrons, the state of light, and other technologies have emerged. Whatever the approach, calculations done by over 50-qubit quantum computers will outrun classical supercomputers.</p>
    <p class="normal">The competition is<a id="_idIndexMarker920"/> fierce because the market will rapidly become huge. Get ready now to face the disruption that's coming!</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-386" class="title">Representing a qubit</h2>
    <p class="normal">The mathematical <a id="_idIndexMarker921"/>representation of a qubit is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list"><img src="../Images/B15438_19_001.png" alt=""/> for a 0 value</li>
      <li class="list"><img src="../Images/B15438_19_002.png" alt=""/> for a 1 value</li>
      <li class="list"><img src="../Images/B15438_19_003.png" alt=""/> where alpha is a probability parameter</li>
      <li class="list"><img src="../Images/B15438_19_004.png" alt=""/> where beta is a probability parameter</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">These brackets are called bracket or bra-ket notation.</p>
    <p class="normal">This linear representation is called superposition. In itself, it explains most of the power of quantum computing.</p>
    <p class="normal">The superposition of 0 and 1 in a quantum state can thus be expressed as follows in kets such as <img src="../Images/B15438_19_005.png" alt=""/> and not bras such as in <img src="../Images/B15438_19_006.png" alt=""/>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_19_007.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="normal">The alpha and beta probabilities look like weights, and the total probabilities of those probable states of qubit must add up to 1. We use partition functions, softmax, and other techniques to make sure to keep the sum of probabilities equal to 1. This is no surprise since computer geeks like us designed the way to program quantum computers.</p>
    <p class="normal">Translated into mathematics, this means that the probabilities of <img src="../Images/B15438_19_008.png" alt=""/> and <img src="../Images/B15438_19_009.png" alt=""/> must add up to 1. In the case of qubit probabilities, the values are squared, leading to the following constraint:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_19_010.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">To describe the probable state of a qubit, we thus need three numbers: the 0 and 1 possible states and a number to determine the value of the probabilities (the other is implicit since the total must add up to 1).</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Since qubits <a id="_idIndexMarker922"/>interact in their respective states, an interaction is described as an entanglement. An entanglement designates at least two interacting qubits. They cannot be described without taking all the states of all the qubits into account.</p>
    <p class="normal">This has been reproduced physically, which means that this entanglement seems strange because their quantum entanglement (relation) can occur at a distance. One qubit can influence a qubit that is physically far away.</p>
    <p class="normal">It's an odd way to think, and one that was not readily accepted at first. Albert Einstein is oft-quoted as referring to entanglement derisively as "spooky action at a distance."</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-387" class="title">The position of a qubit</h2>
    <p class="normal">One of the main ways to<a id="_idIndexMarker923"/> represent the state of a qubit is by using the Bloch sphere. It shows how a qubit spins and can be used to describe qubit states. To properly grasp this, the following section will first provide a refresher on some properties of a circle.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-388" class="title">Radians, degrees, and rotations</h3>
    <p class="normal">The radius<a id="_idIndexMarker924"/> is the distance between the center of a circle and its circumference, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_19_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.1: Radius of a circle</p>
    <p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker925"/> radius of a circle is half of the circle's diameter. The relation between the radius <em class="italics">r</em> and the circumference <em class="italics">C</em> is (where <img src="../Images/B15438_19_011.png" alt=""/>):</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_19_012.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="normal">If the length of the<a id="_idIndexMarker926"/> radius is wrapped around the circumference of a circle, that arc forms a radian, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_19_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.2: A radian</p>
    <p class="normal">The angle formed by a<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> radian is equal to about 57.29° (degrees).</p>
    <p class="normal">The properties of the radian can be used<a id="_idIndexMarker928"/> for rotations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">3.14 × 57.29° = about 180°</li>
      <li class="list">Thus <img src="../Images/B15438_19_013.png" alt=""/> radians = 180°</li>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-390" class="title">Composing a quantum score</h2>
    <p class="normal">Composing a <a id="_idIndexMarker932"/>quantum score consists of positioning gates on a stave (or circuit) and adding a measurement. The input comes from a classical computer. After the measurement phase, the output goes back to a classical computer. The reason is that quantum computers have no memory and thus cannot store their intermediate states because of their instability.</p>

A development kit can also be downloaded, and the APIs are functional. IBM provides extensive and detailed documentation on all the aspects of this approach.</p>
    <p class="normal">All of this being said, let's find out how quantum computing can boost an AI project. It is now time to define the thinking quantum computer project.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-394" class="title">A thinking quantum computer</h1>
    <p class="normal">A thinking quantum computer<a id="_idIndexMarker953"/> is not a reproduction of brain function, but rather a representation of the mind of a person. Neuromorphic computing is one approach that represents our neurons and how brain uses spiking neurons to think. Quantum computing can provide an exciting way to imitate our mind's capacity with mathematical algorithms that work with qubits, not neurons. We've just begun to explore the potential of these approaches, which in fact will most probably merge into an ensemble of hybrid software and hardware solutions.</p>
    <p class="normal">The endeavor of the quantum MindX experiment is to build a personal mind named MindX, with memories of past events, conversations, chats, and photographs stored on a classical computer. The program will then transform subsets of the data into quantum circuits to see what happens, how our quantum circuit behaves when left to produce millions of possibilities.</p>
    <p class="normal">This section describes how to build MindX, a thinking computer that is just a research project. It must be noted that this approach is experimental. It could be viewed as an advanced mind experiment. I've been doing research on this subject for many years. The power of quantum computation will no doubt boost research in this field.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-395" class="title">Representing our mind's concepts</h2>
    <p class="normal">The input consists of encoding a state of mind of a PCA CRLMM representation, as we built in <em class="italics">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italics">Preparing the Input of Chatbots with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</em>. The CRLMM representation is not a general dictionary or encyclopedia dataset but a mind-dataset of actual personal data that is collected, classified, and transformed into a PCA.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-396" class="title">Expanding MindX's conceptual representations</h2>
    <p class="normal">MindX's mind dataset will grow<a id="_idIndexMarker954"/> continuously if implemented beyond this research experiment. It will have sensors to process body temperature for emotion classification, facial recognition for expression detection, body language detectors, and more. All of this technology is already available. The New York Stock Exchange already has artificial intelligence IoT agents that gather information from outer sources to make decisions. These AI agents have replaced a large amount of human decision-making. Imagine what is going to happen when quantum computing becomes disruptive!</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-397" class="title">The MindX experiment</h2>
    <p class="normal">The aim of the <a id="_idIndexMarker955"/>quantum MindX experiment is to build a mind and let it think with the power of a quantum computer. This section will show how to run a 16-qubit mind.</p>
    <p class="normal">The size of the numbers needed to describe a 16-qubit quantum simulation is 65,536.</p>
    <p class="normal">This section first describes how to do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Prepare the data</li>
      <li class="list">Create and run a quantum score</li>
      <li class="list">Use the output</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let's get on with preparing the data.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-398" class="title">Preparing the data</h3>
    <p class="normal">To prepare data for <a id="_idIndexMarker956"/>higher-dimension calculations, I have been using a concept encoding method for corporate projects for over 30 years to provide embedded data to the algorithms I have developed. This guarantees high-level abstraction to solve problems. It is a very profitable way to implement transfer learning and domain learning. This way, you can apply the same model to many different fields.</p>
    <p class="normal">The method consists of embedding data with the methods described in this book. The goal always remains the same—to transform the data points into higher dimensions to visualize features.</p>
    <p class="normal">For quantum computing, the method remains the same for the MindX experiment.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-399" class="title">Transformation functions – the situation function</h3>
    <p class="normal">Two functions need to be <a id="_idIndexMarker957"/>applied before creating and running a score: a state of mind function and a quantum transformation function.</p>
    <p class="normal">The situation function consists of building a vector of features in PCA dimensions. We accomplished this in <em class="italics">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italics">Preparing the Input of Chatbots with Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA),</em> and applied it to a chatbot in <em class="italics">Chapter 15</em>, <em class="italics">Setting Up a Cognitive NLP UI/CUI Chatbot</em>. The chatbot was able to use person X's mind-dataset to build a meaningful dialog.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, the quantum dimensions will provide the chatbot with a nascent personal mind, not a general mind that can recognize, classify, and predict like a machine. </p>
    <p class="normal">MindX has a mind that is biased by its way of thinking like humans. MindX has an exceptionally open mind to adapt to everyone, which gives it empathy.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">MindX can doubt. Thus it can learn better than dogmatic machines.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">A situation function will create a situation matrix for a movie suggestion by the MindX bot, which will communicate with consumers. In a situation where a movie suggestion is made by the MindX bot, for example, it could be something as follows for 16 qubits:</p>

    <p class="normal">The state of mind of MindX, a random person, is now in a matrix, and its concepts have now been transformed into a quantum dimension, in which the data status can be traced throughout the creation of the quantum score.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-401" class="title">Creating and running the score</h3>
    <p class="normal">A thought process of MindX is described in a quantum score. There are two ways to build this score:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="list">Manually, just<a id="_idIndexMarker962"/> like a musician writing a music score. This requires thinking about the previous logic gate and the effect of the next one, taking a decision process into account. It is like writing any artificial intelligence program.</li>
      <li class="list">Automatically, by building a function that reads a rule base of MindX's way of thinking and applies the quantum gates through that rule base. You can apply this to machine learning and deep learning as well to test the performance of a quantum computer versus a classical one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">In any case, it requires writing an algorithm. This algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that takes emotions into account. Doubt, for example, is what keeps many humans from making bad decisions. Too much doubt, for example, will make a person back out of a situation.</p>
    <p class="normal">Here is the quantum<a id="_idIndexMarker963"/> transcription of an algorithm that takes MindX's concepts into account and represents how they interact. This requires very precise thinking and cognitive science programming.</p>
    <p class="normal">The following is an <a id="_idIndexMarker964"/>experimental quantum score I built with Quirk:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/B15438_19_15.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.15: Quantum score built with Quirk</p>
    <p class="normal">Once the quantum score has been run and the measurement has been done, the green rectangles on the right provide the output.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-402" class="title">Using the output</h3>
    <p class="normal">The output of the <a id="_idIndexMarker965"/>quantum score is now added as a column to the situation matrix. If you want to implement such solutions, just bear in mind that it will take some time to write the functions with some sweat and tea to make it through the nights. MindX could be used to enhance a chatbot with unplanned responses. MindX has proven it has imagination potential.</p>

    <p class="normal">MindX has given a 65,536 quantum state description of its thoughts about suggesting a given movie to person X. Lines 15 and 16 show that the normalized polarity value has risen over 0.5 to a positive feeling about the movie.</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-403" class="title">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">Quantum computers have opened the door to scientific experiments that could never have been carried out with classical computers. Within a few years, quantum computers will have become mainstream, unavoidable, and a key asset for businesses and research labs. The race has begun to conquer the market.</p>
    <p class="normal">CRLMM applied to quantum computers could make MindX one of the most powerful thinking minds on earth—human or machine.</p>
    <p class="normal">With an unlimited mind-dataset and a 2<sup style="font-style: italic;">q</sup> quantum computer starting at 250, a 50-qubit machine, MindX could gain the thinking power and experience of a human who has lived for 1,000 years. MindX's thinking power and an exponential amount of real-time memory of past experiences, loaded through transformation functions, could help solve many medical, logistic, and other decision-making problems.</p>
    <p class="normal">Quantum thinking has just begun to change the perception of the world. Conceptual AI models such as CRLMM will no doubt be the starting point for the next generation of AI solutions. These CRLMM models will be much more powerful because they will be gifted with empathy and complex minds.</p>
    <p class="normal">Hopefully, this overview of quantum computing will open the doors of your imagination to the new world awaiting you!</p>
