- en: fastai is an easy-to-use deep learning framework built on top of PyTorch that
    lets you rapidly create complete deep learning solutions with as few as 10 lines
    of code. Both of the predominant low-level deep learning frameworks today (TensorFlow
    and PyTorch) require a lot of code, even for straightforward applications. In
    contrast, fastai handles the messy details for you and lets you focus on applying
    deep learning to actually solve problems.

- en: 'We will start by summarizing the value of fastai and showing a simple "hello
    world" deep learning application with fastai. Then, we will describe how to use
    fastai for each of the four application areas that the framework explicitly supports:
    tabular data, text data (NLP), recommender systems, and vision data. You will
    work through a series of practical examples that illustrate how to create real-world
    applications of each type. After that, you will learn how to deploy fastai models.
    For example, you will learn how to create a simple web application that predicts
    what object is depicted in an image. Finally, we will wrap up with an overview
    of the advanced features of fastai.'

    using fastai. You'll know how to use fastai to prepare raw datasets, explore datasets,
    train deep learning models, and deploy trained models.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for data scientists, machine learning developers, and deep learning
    enthusiasts who are looking to learn and explore the fastai framework using a
    recipe-based approach. Working knowledge of the Python programming language and
    machine learning basics are strongly recommended to get the most out of this book.

    of deep learning application areas, but it is not an exhaustive reference for
    the platform. To get comprehensive details on fastai, please see the *Conclusion
    and additional resources on fastai* section in [*Chapter 8*](B16216_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205)*,
    Extended fastai and Deployment Features*. This section points to additional fastai
    content, including the excellent deep learning courses built around fastai created
    by Jeremy Howard and his team.

    with fastai,* shows you how to set up an environment for fastai, takes you through
    training an initial *hello world* fastai model, explains the four key application
    areas of fastai (tabular data, text data, recommender systems, and image data),
    and compares fastai with the other important high-level deep learning framework,

    tabular, text, and image datasets; and shows how to use the facilities of fastai

- en: To get the most out of this book, you should be comfortable with coding in Python
    (in Jupyter notebooks and in standalone Python modules) and with the core concepts
    of machine learning. This book explains a broad variety of deep learning applications
    but doesn't go into the internals of deep learning itself. If you have a basic
    grasp of how deep learning works, you will find the more advanced examples in
    the book easier to follow.

    cloud deep learning Jupyter notebook environments. You have the choice of using
    either **Paperspace Gradient** or **Google Colab** for these examples, with Gradient
    being the recommended environment. The model deployment examples in [*Chapter
    7*](B16216_07_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178), *Deployment and Model Maintenance*,
    and [*Chapter 8*](B16216_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205), *Extended fastai
    and Deployment Features*, are designed to be run on your local system and require
    fastai and PyTorch to be installed on your local system.
