- en: 'This book aims to introduce you to the concepts and practices of deep learning
    networks. A number of case studies based on deep learning solutions are studied.
    In each case study, a neural architecture is explained and implemented through
    the codeless KNIME Analytics Platform tool. We start with a brief introduction
    to the basic concepts of deep learning and the visual programming KNIME Analytics
    Platform tool. Once the basic concepts are clear, we continue on with case studies
    on the usage of deep learning architectures to solve specific tasks: a neural
    autoencoder for fraud detection, recurrent neural networks for demand prediction
    and natural language processing, an encoder-decoder architecture for neural machine
    translation, and a convolutional neural network for image classification. The
    book concludes by describing the deployment options of trained networks and offering
    a few tips and tricks to train and successfully apply a deep learning network.'

- en: If you have always wanted to develop solutions based on deep learning networks
    but you have not wanted to invest the time in learning how to code, this book
    is for you. It teaches you the basics of the algorithms behind deep learning and
    how to practically and codelessly build, train, and evaluate deep learning networks.
    While a codeless tool reduces the entrance barrier considerably, the complexity
    behind deep learning networks remains. A math background is required to understand
    the data shaping and operations as well as the math behind the algorithms.
