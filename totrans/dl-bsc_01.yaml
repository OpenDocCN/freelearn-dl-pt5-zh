- en: As technology advances, what was once termed science fiction begins to look
    increasingly plausible—even, at times, realistic. Artificial intelligence has
    beaten shogi, chess, and even igo champions. Smartphones can understand human
    speech, and video calls can provide real-time machine interpretation. "No-crash
    cars" with built-in cameras protect human lives, and automatic vehicles are getting
    closer to practical use. When we look around, we find that artificial intelligence
    flawlessly performs what we once thought exclusively human tasks—even, at times,
    surpassing us. The development of artificial intelligence is changing our world,
    making it anew.

    Researchers around the world praise deep learning as an innovative technology,
    even calling it a once-in-decade breakthrough. The term is now as familiar to
    the general public as it is to researchers and engineers.'

    cars, and in servers that empower Web services. Deep learning is operating today
    in places where many people do not notice it. In the future, deep learning will
    more clearly step out into the light. This book will help you understand and be

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is about deep learning and covers the knowledge required to understand
    it step by step from the basics, including what it is, what it entails, and how
    it works as simply as possible to give readers a deeper understanding of the relevant
    technologies.

- en: Then what should we do to better understand deep learning? Well, one of the
    best ways is by making something—for example, performing practical tasks to create
    a program that runs from scratch that promotes critical thinking while reading
    a source code. Now, "from scratch" in this context means using as little external
    already-made items (such as libraries and tools) as possible. The goal of this
    book is to use as little as possible of these "black boxes", whose contents are
    unknown, meaning that you begin with minimal basic knowledge, upon which you will
    build, analyze, and implement to understand and make state-of-the-art deep learning
    programs. If you were to compare this book to a car manual, it is not a manual
    that shows how to drive a car but rather one that focuses on understanding the
    principle of a car. It directs you to open the hood of the car, remove and examine
    each individual piece for its form, function, and placement before putting it
    back together and building your model to its exact dimensions and operations.
    The goal of this book is to make you feel that you can make a car and be familiar
    with the technologies around it through the process of making it.

    deep learning. Python is a very popular programming language that is easy for
    beginners to use. It is especially suitable for making prototypes. You can try
    your ideas immediately and conduct various experiments while checking the results.
    This book describes the theoretical aspects of deep learning while implementing
    Python programs and conducting experiments.

    description, you can often discern by reading and running a source code, getting
    a feel for the flow of technologies. This book puts emphasis on "engineering"—understanding
    deep learning through making something by writing codes. You will see many mathematical
    expressions and also many source codes from a programmer's point of view.

    it by only listening to explanations. As an ancient Chinese philosopher said,
    You forget what you heard. You learn what you saw. You can understand what you
    did. Practice is the most important when you learn something new. This book often
    provides practical examples (source codes that you can run) after explaining a
    concept.

    Sometimes we are at a loss and stop to think why something has happened. Such
    time-consuming activities give us important knowledge in understanding technology
    deeply. The knowledge obtained after such a long time is surely useful also in
    using existing libraries, reading cutting-edge papers, and making an original
    system. Above all, making something is fun. Now, we are ready. Let's start on
    our journey of deep learning!
