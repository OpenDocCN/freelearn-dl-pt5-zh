			<p>In this section, we will learn about the five stages of the full life cycle of <strong class="bold">deep learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">DL</strong>), and understand the emerging field of <strong class="bold">machine learning operations</strong> (<strong class="bold">MLOps</strong>) and the role of MLflow. We will provide an overview of the challenges in the four pillars of a DL process: data, model, code, and explainability. Then, we will learn how to set up a basic local MLflow development environment and run our first MLflow experiment for a <strong class="bold">natural language processing</strong> (<strong class="bold">NLP</strong>) model built on top of <strong class="bold">PyTorch Lightning Flash</strong>. Finally, we will explain the foundational MLflow concepts such as experiments, runs, and many more, through this first MLflow experiment example. </p>
