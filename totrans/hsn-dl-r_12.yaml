- en: This section will demonstrate reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement
    learning. The reader will learn how reinforcement learning differs from both supervised
    and unsupervised learning algorithms. The reader will use this machine learning
    technique in a number of situations to solve problems where discrete actions lead
    to an increased or reduced probability of a positive outcome.
