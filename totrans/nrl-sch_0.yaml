- en: We live in the digital era, and creating data becomes easier every day. According
    to Forbes, we generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day, and this data comes
    from all types of sources. It can be pictures on Instagram, voice messages on
    Telegram, videos, text, or even a combination of all of them. This was definitely
    not the case when the internet was just starting. And yet, despite the obvious
    difference in the easiness of data creation before and now, we keep using the
    same search techniques. Despite having an incredible boom in data generation,
    we haven’t updated our search techniques that much.

- en: Neural search is the approach to changing that. It takes advantage of the **machine
    learning** (**ML**) era that we live in right now and uses the latest AI research
    to deliver novel search techniques. However, despite this being a good technique,
    it presents a lot of challenges. Neural search is a whole new concept, which means
    the knowledge and techniques needed are also new. To effectively deploy a neural
    search application, the engineers in charge of it need to have a plethora of skills,
    from engineering to Dev-Ops, and an ML background.

- en: This is the problem Jina AI wants to solve. Jina is an open source solution
    that is designed to democratize AI and neural search, making it easier for many
    developers to have a full end-to-end neural search application without having
    to have a background in ML, the cloud, and backend engineering. It’s designed
    with Python developers in mind to help them unlock the full potential of the latest
    neural search techniques. In this book, we will explore the basics of search,
    from traditional to neural search. With this knowledge, we will work through hands-on
    examples of creating a fully fledged neural application.

- en: If you are an ML, **deep learning** (**DL**), or AI engineer interested in building
    a search system of any kind (text, QA, image, audio, PDF, 3D models, and so on)
    using modern software architecture, this book is for you. This book is also excellent
    for Python engineers who are interested in building a search system (of any kind)
    using state-of-the-art DL techniques.
