			<p>fastai is an easy-to-use deep learning framework built on top of PyTorch that lets you rapidly create complete deep learning solutions with as few as 10 lines of code. Both of the predominant low-level deep learning frameworks today (TensorFlow and PyTorch) require a lot of code, even for straightforward applications. In contrast, fastai handles the messy details for you and lets you focus on applying deep learning to actually solve problems.</p>
			<p>We will start by summarizing the value of fastai and showing a simple "hello world" deep learning application with fastai. Then, we will describe how to use fastai for each of the four application areas that the framework explicitly supports: tabular data, text data (NLP), recommender systems, and vision data. You will work through a series of practical examples that illustrate how to create real-world applications of each type. After that, you will learn how to deploy fastai models. For example, you will learn how to create a simple web application that predicts what object is depicted in an image. Finally, we will wrap up with an overview of the advanced features of fastai.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will be able to create your own deep learning applications using fastai. You'll know how to use fastai to prepare raw datasets, explore datasets, train deep learning models, and deploy trained models.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for data scientists, machine learning developers, and deep learning enthusiasts who are looking to learn and explore the fastai framework using a recipe-based approach. Working knowledge of the Python programming language and machine learning basics are strongly recommended to get the most out of this book.</p>
			<p>This book provides practical examples of how to use fastai to tackle a variety of deep learning application areas, but it is not an exhaustive reference for the platform. To get comprehensive details on fastai, please see the <em class="italic">Conclusion and additional resources on fastai</em> section in <a href="B16216_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a><em class="italic">, Extended fastai and Deployment Features</em>. This section points to additional fastai content, including the excellent deep learning courses built around fastai created by Jeremy Howard and his team.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B16216_01_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor019"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with fastai,</em> shows you how to set up an environment for fastai, takes you through training an initial <em class="italic">hello world</em> fastai model, explains the four key application areas of fastai (tabular data, text data, recommender systems, and image data), and compares fastai with the other important high-level deep learning framework, Keras.</p>
			<p><a href="B16216_02_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor057"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring and Cleaning Up Data with fastai,</em> describes the set of datasets that fastai makes available out of the box (the <strong class="bold">curated</strong> datasets); describes how to examine tabular, text, and image datasets; and shows how to use the facilities of fastai to clean up a dataset, for example, by dealing with missing values.</p>
			<p><a href="B16216_03_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor083"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Training Models with Tabular Data,</em> explains how to create fastai deep learning models trained on tabular datasets, that is, datasets that are arranged in rows and columns. Examples in this chapter show you how to train fastai models on both curated and standalone datasets.</p>
			<p><a href="B16216_04_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor109"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Training Models with Text Data,</em> explains how to create fastai deep learning models trained on text datasets. Examples in this chapter show you how to train language models (that is, models that predict the next word given a series of words), as well as how to train text classification models (that is, models that predict, for example, whether a given review is negative or positive). This chapter covers models trained with both curated and standalone datasets.</p>
			<p><a href="B16216_05_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Training Recommender Systems,</em> explains how to use fastai to create recommender systems, that is models that predict, for example, whether a particular reader will like a particular book given a set of ratings that other readers have provided for this book. This chapter covers recommender systems trained with both curated and standalone datasets.</p>
			<p><a href="B16216_06_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor152"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Training Models with Visual Data,</em> explains how to use fastai to create deep learning models trained on image datasets. Examples in this chapter show you how to create image classification systems for images that depict one or more objects, trained on both curated and standalone datasets.</p>
			<p><a href="B16216_07_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deployment and Model Maintenance,</em> explains how you can take a trained fastai model and deploy it in a simple web application. The examples in this chapter show you how to deploy fastai deep learning models trained on tabular and image datasets. This chapter also tells you how to maintain models once they have been deployed.</p>
			<p><a href="B16216_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Extended fastai and Deployment Features,</em> explains additional aspects of fastai, including enhancements to the models introduced from <a href="B16216_03_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor083"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a><em class="italic">,</em> <em class="italic">Training Models with Tabular Data</em>, to <a href="B16216_06_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor152"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">,</em> <em class="italic">Training Models with Visual Data</em>, as well as variations on the deployment techniques introduced in <a href="B16216_07_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deployment and Model Maintenance</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>To get the most out of this book, you should be comfortable with coding in Python (in Jupyter notebooks and in standalone Python modules) and with the core concepts of machine learning. This book explains a broad variety of deep learning applications but doesn't go into the internals of deep learning itself. If you have a basic grasp of how deep learning works, you will find the more advanced examples in the book easier to follow.</p>

			<p>Most of the code examples in this book are designed to be run in GPU-enabled cloud deep learning Jupyter notebook environments. You have the choice of using either <strong class="bold">Paperspace Gradient</strong> or <strong class="bold">Google Colab</strong> for these examples, with Gradient being the recommended environment. The model deployment examples in <a href="B16216_07_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deployment and Model Maintenance</em>, and <a href="B16216_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Extended fastai and Deployment Features</em>, are designed to be run on your local system and require fastai and PyTorch to be installed on your local system.</p>
