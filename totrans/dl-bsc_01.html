			<p>As technology advances, what was once termed science fiction begins to look increasingly plausible—even, at times, realistic. Artificial intelligence has beaten shogi, chess, and even igo champions. Smartphones can understand human speech, and video calls can provide real-time machine interpretation. "No-crash cars" with built-in cameras protect human lives, and automatic vehicles are getting closer to practical use. When we look around, we find that artificial intelligence flawlessly performs what we once thought exclusively human tasks—even, at times, surpassing us. The development of artificial intelligence is changing our world, making it anew.</p>
			<p>"Deep learning" technology plays an important role in such remarkable developments. Researchers around the world praise deep learning as an innovative technology, even calling it a once-in-decade breakthrough. The term is now as familiar to the general public as it is to researchers and engineers.</p>
			<p>This book focuses on deep learning, which has been receiving a lot of attention. The purpose is for readers to understand deep learning technologies as comprehensively as possible.</p>
			<p>Approaching the essence of deep learning through a process of implementing deep learning programs, this book attempts to exhaustively detail required technologies and functional, practical examples with which readers can experiment.</p>
			<p>Deep learning is already used all around the world—in smartphones, in self-driving cars, and in servers that empower Web services. Deep learning is operating today in places where many people do not notice it. In the future, deep learning will more clearly step out into the light. This book will help you understand and be fascinated by its associated technologies.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Concept of this book</h3>
			<p>This book is about deep learning and covers the knowledge required to understand it step by step from the basics, including what it is, what it entails, and how it works as simply as possible to give readers a deeper understanding of the relevant technologies. </p>
			<p>Then what should we do to better understand deep learning? Well, one of the best ways is by making something—for example, performing practical tasks to create a program that runs from scratch that promotes critical thinking while reading a source code. Now, "from scratch" in this context means using as little external already-made items (such as libraries and tools) as possible. The goal of this book is to use as little as possible of these "black boxes", whose contents are unknown, meaning that you begin with minimal basic knowledge, upon which you will build, analyze, and implement to understand and make state-of-the-art deep learning programs. If you were to compare this book to a car manual, it is not a manual that shows how to drive a car but rather one that focuses on understanding the principle of a car. It directs you to open the hood of the car, remove and  examine each individual piece for its form, function, and placement before putting it back together and building your model to its exact dimensions and operations. The goal of this book is to make you feel that you can make a car and be familiar with the technologies around it through the process of making it.</p>
			<p>In this book, we will use a programming language called Python to carry out deep learning. Python is a very popular programming language that is easy for beginners to use. It is especially suitable for making prototypes. You can try your ideas immediately and conduct various experiments while checking the results. This book describes the theoretical aspects of deep learning while implementing Python programs and conducting experiments.</p>
			<p>What you cannot understand only with a mathematical expression or theoretical description, you can often discern by reading and running a source code,  getting a feel for the flow of technologies. This book puts emphasis on "engineering"—understanding deep learning through making something by writing codes. You will see many mathematical expressions and also many source codes from a programmer's point of view.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>For whom is this book written?</h3>
			<p>This book provides activities for implementation so that you can better understand deep learning. The following lists the lesson objectives for this course:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use Python and the minimum possible external libraries to implement deep learning programs from scratch.</li>
				<li>Describe how to use Python for Python beginners.</li>
				<li>Provide Python source codes that you can run and a learning environment where you can experiment.</li>
				<li>Implement a system that recognizes images with high precision, starting from simple machine learning problems</li>
				<li>Clearly explain deep learning and neural network theories.</li>
				<li>Explain technologies that look complicated, such as backpropagation and convolution, so that you can understand them on an implementation level.</li>
				<li>Describe useful and practical techniques for deep learning, such as how to determine learning coefficients and the initial values of weights.</li>
				<li>Describe and implement trends such as Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Adam.</li>
				<li>Determine the reasons why deep learning is excellent, why a deeper layer improves recognition precision, and why a hidden layer is important.</li>
				<li>Introduce applications of deep learning, such as automatic driving, image generation, and reinforcement learning.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>For whom is this book not written?</h3>
			<p>It is also important to show for whom this book is not written. The following lists what we will not do in this book.</p>
			<p>This book…</p>
			<ul>
				<li>does not describe or introduce the latest research about deep learning in detail.</li>
				<li>does not describe how to use deep learning frameworks, such as Caffe, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.</li>
				<li>does not provide a detailed theoretical descriptions about deep learning, particularly neural networks.</li>
				<li>does not provide detailed description about tuning for improving recognition precision in deep learning.</li>
				<li>does not deal with GPU implementation to accelerate deep learning.</li>
				<li>focuses on image recognition. It does not cover natural language processing or speech recognition.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, this book does not cover the latest research or theoretical details. However, when you are nearing the end of this book, you can then proceed with the latest research papers and theoretical books about neural networks.</p>
			<p>This book focuses on image recognition. You can mainly learn the technologies required for image recognition using deep learning. It does not cover natural language processing or speech recognition.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>How to read this book</h3>
			<p>When we learn something new, we often fail to understand it or may soon forget it by only listening to explanations. As an ancient Chinese philosopher said, You forget what you heard. You learn what you saw. You can understand what you did. Practice  is the most important when you learn something new. This book often provides practical examples (source codes that you can run) after explaining a concept.</p>
			<p>This book provides Python code that you can run on your computer for practical implementation to reinforce and apply theory, as well as experimentation through trial and error.</p>
			<p>This book will advance on the pair of wheels of "theoretical explanation" and "implementation by Python." It is recommended that you have an environment for programming. You can use a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with this book. <em class="italics">Chapter 1</em> <em class="italics">Introduction to Python</em> describes how to install and use Python. You can download the programs used in this book from the following GitHub repository.</p>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/koki0702/deep-learning-from-the-basics">https://github.com/koki0702/deep-learning-from-the-basics</a></p>
			<p>This ends the introduction and should have given you an overview of what you will be doing in this book and, hopefully, the desire to continue reading further.</p>
			<p>In these next chapters, you will conduct various experiments during the process. Sometimes we are at a loss and stop to think why something has happened. Such time-consuming activities give us important knowledge in understanding technology deeply. The knowledge obtained after such a long time is surely useful also in using existing libraries, reading cutting-edge papers, and making an original system. Above all, making something is fun. Now, we are ready. Let's start on our journey of deep learning!</p>
