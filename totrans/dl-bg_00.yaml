- en: For years, those who have been faithfully working on machine learning have seen
    the field grow and flourish, yielding amazing technology and even promising radical
    societal changes. However, for those who want to join us in studying this area,
    it might seem a little bit intimidating. Certainly, there is so much stuff out
    there on the web and it has become very difficult to navigate through all the
    papers, and the code, to find reliable introductory content for those who want
    to join us in the field of deep learning. While there are many introductory books
    on machine learning, most are inadequate in addressing the needs of those who
    specifically want to work on deep learning and have the minimum necessary mathematical,
    algorithmic, and programming skills.

- en: This book aims to reach out to those beginners in deep learning who are looking
    for a strong foundation in the basic concepts required to build deep learning
    models using well-known methodologies. If that sounds like you, then this book
    might be what you need. The book assumes no prior extensive exposure to neural
    networks and deep learning and starts by reviewing the machine learning fundamentals
    needed for deep learning. Then, it explains how to prepare data by cleaning and
    preprocessing it for deep learning and gradually goes on to introduce neural networks
    and the popular supervised neural network architectures, such as **convolutional
    neural networks** (**CNNs**), **recurrent neural networks** (**RNNs**), and **generative
    adversarial networks** (**GANs**), and unsupervised architectures, such as **autoencoders**
    (**AEs**), **variational autoencoders** (**VAEs**), and **restricted Boltzmann
    machines** (**RBMs**). At the end of each chapter, you will have a chance to test
    your understanding of the concepts and reflect on your own growth.

    to Deep Learning Frameworks*, helps you in the process of setting up TensorFlow
    and Keras and introduces their usefulness and purpose in deep learning. This chapter
    also briefly introduces other deep learning libraries to get you acquainted with
    them in some small way.'

    introduces you to the main concepts behind data processing to make it useful in
    deep learning. It will cover essential concepts of formatting outputs and inputs
    that are categorical or real-valued, as well as exploring techniques for augmenting
    data or reducing the dimensions of data.'
