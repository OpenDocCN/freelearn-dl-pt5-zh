- en: In this section, we will learn about the foundational concepts of explainability
    and **explainable artificial intelligence** (**XAI**) and how to implement **deep
    learning** (**DL**) explainability with MLflow. We will start with an overview
    of the eight dimensions of explainability and then learn how to use **SHapley
    Additive exPlanations** (**SHAP**) and **Transformers Interpret** to perform explainability
    for a **natural language processing** (**NLP**) pipeline. Furthermore, we will
    learn and analyze the current MLflow integration with SHAP to understand the trade-offs
    and avoid potential implementation problems. Then, we will show how to implement
    SHAP using MLflow's logging APIs. Finally, we will learn how to implement a SHAP
    explainer as an MLflow Python model and then load it as either a Spark UDF for
    batch explanation or as a web service for online **Explanation-as-a-Service**
    (**EaaS**).
