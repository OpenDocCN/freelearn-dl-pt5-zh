- en: The book will start from the theoretical foundations of deep **neural networks**
    (**NN**), and it will delve into the most popular network architectures – transformers,
    transformer-based **large language models** (**LLMs**), and convolutional networks.
    It will introduce these models in the context of various computer vision and **natural
    language processing** (**NLP**) examples, including state-of-the-art applications
    such as text-to-image generation and chatbots.

- en: Each chapter is organized with a comprehensive theoretical introduction to the
    topic as its main body. This is followed by coding examples that serve to validate
    the presented theory, providing readers with practical hands-on experience. The
    examples are executed using PyTorch, Keras, or Hugging Face Transformers.

    you don’t have one. To avoid any hardware limitations, all code examples are available
    as Jupyter notebooks, executed on Google Colab. So, even if your hardware is not
    sufficient to run the examples, you can still run them under Colab.
