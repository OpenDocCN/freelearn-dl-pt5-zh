			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>This book aims to introduce you to the concepts and practices of deep learning networks. A number of case studies based on deep learning solutions are studied. In each case study, a neural architecture is explained and implemented through the codeless KNIME Analytics Platform tool. We start with a brief introduction to the basic concepts of deep learning and the visual programming KNIME Analytics Platform tool. Once the basic concepts are clear, we continue on with case studies on the usage of deep learning architectures to solve specific tasks: a neural autoencoder for fraud detection, recurrent neural networks for demand prediction and natural language processing, an encoder-decoder architecture for neural machine translation, and a convolutional neural network for image classification. The book concludes by describing the deployment options of trained networks and offering a few tips and tricks to train and successfully apply a deep learning network.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>If you have always wanted to develop solutions based on deep learning networks but you have not wanted to invest the time in learning how to code, this book is for you. It teaches you the basics of the algorithms behind deep learning and how to practically and codelessly build, train, and evaluate deep learning networks. While a codeless tool reduces the entrance barrier considerably, the complexity behind deep learning networks remains. A math background is required to understand the data shaping and operations as well as the math behind the algorithms.</p>

			<p><a href="B16391_03_Final_PG_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Neural Networks</em>, is the only theoretical chapter of the book. It paints an overview of the basic concepts around neural and deep learning networks and the algorithms used to train them.</p>
			<p><a href="B16391_04_Final_NM_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Building and Training a Feedforward Neural Network</em>, is where we put into practice what we describe in <a href="B16391_03_Final_PG_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Neural Networks</em>; we will build, train, and evaluate our first simple feedforward networks for classification tasks.</p>
			<p><a href="B16391_05_Final_NM_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor152"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Autoencoder for Fraud Detection</em>, is where, with a neural autoencoder to solve the problem of fraud detection in credit card transactions, we start the series of case studies based on deep learning solutions.</p>
			<p><a href="B16391_06_Final_VK_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Recurrent Neural Networks for Demand Prediction</em>, is where we introduce <strong class="bold">Long Short-Term Memory</strong> (<strong class="bold">LSTM</strong>) models in recurrent neural networks. Indeed, with their dynamic behavior, they are particularly effective in solving time series problems, such as a classic demand prediction problem.</p>
			<p><a href="B16391_07_Final_NM_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor230"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing NLP Applications</em>, covers how LSTM-based recurrent neural networks are often also used to implement solutions for natural language processing tasks. In this chapter, we cover a few case studies for free text generation, free name generation, and sentiment analysis.</p>
			<p><a href="B16391_08_Final_SK_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor290"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Neural Machine Translation</em>, looks at an encoder-decoder architecture for automatic translations.</p>
			<p><a href="B16391_09_Final_NM_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor316"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification</em>, covers a case study on image classification, which we could not miss. We classify histopathology images into cancer diagnoses using a convolutional neural network.</p>
			<p><a href="B16391_10_Final_VK_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor367"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying a Deep Learning Network</em>, starts describing the deployment phase. A simple example of the deployment workflow is explained in detail.</p>
			<p><a href="B16391_11_Final_NM_ePUB.xhtml#_idTextAnchor386"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Best Practices and Other Deployment Options</em>, extends the previous chapter dedicated to deployment with more deployment options, such as web applications and REST services, and we conclude the book with a few tips and tricks.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>KNIME Analytics Platform is a very easy-to-use tool. No previous coding knowledge is necessary.</p>
			<p>Some previous math knowledge, however, is necessary to deal with the data transformations and understand the training algorithms.</p>
