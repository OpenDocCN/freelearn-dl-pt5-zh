- en: '**Deep Learning (DL)** is a relatively new type of machine learning which demonstrates
    incredible results in tasks such as natural language understanding and computer
    vision. At times, DL can be more accurate than humans.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thanks to the proliferation of open source frameworks, publicly available model
    architectures and pertained models, many people and organizations can successfully
    apply cutting-edge DL models to their practical use cases. However, developing,
    training, and deploying DL models also requires highly specialized and costly
    types of hardware, software stacks, expertise, and management capabilities which
    may considerably slow down the adoption.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book focuses on how to engineer and manage Deep Learning workloads on Amazon
    SageMaker, which allows you to overcome the aforementioned barriers. SageMaker
    is a sprawling AWS cloud Machine Learning platform with a variety of capabilities.
    This book does not intend to cover all available SageMaker capabilities in detail,
    but rather dive deep into the features relevant to DL workloads. We prioritized
    depth over breadth when writing this book. The goal of this book is to provide
    you with practical guidelines on how to efficiently implement real-time use cases
    involving Deep Learning models on Amazon SageMaker.

- en: Since cloud adoption and machine learning adoption are both accelerating, this
    book may be of interest to a wide audience, from beginners to experienced ML practitioners.
    Specifically, this book is for ML engineers who work on DL model development and
    training, and Solutions Architects who are in charge of designing and optimizing
    DL workloads.

    of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Familiarity with AWS and practical experience
    working with it are also helpful.

    practical experience working with Amazon SageMaker. It’s recommended that you
    try to run the code samples yourself, however, you may also review them. We also
    provide commentary for code samples as part of each chapter.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17519_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013), *Introducing Deep Learning
    with Amazon SageMaker*, will introduce Amazon SageMaker: how it simplifies infrastructure
    and workload management, and what the key principles of this AWS service and its
    main capabilities are. We will then focus on the managed training, hosting infrastructure,
    and integration with the rest of the AWS services it provides.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B17519_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041), *Deep Learning Frameworks
    and Containers on SageMaker*, will review in detail how SageMaker extensively
    utilizes Docker containers. We will start by diving into pre-built containers
    for popular DL frameworks (Tensorflow, PyTorch, and MXNet). Then, we will consider
    how to extend pre-build SageMaker containers and BYO containers. For the latter
    case, we will review the technical requirements for training and serving containers
    in SageMaker.'

    Environment*, will discuss how to manage SageMaker resources programmatically
    using a CLI, SDKs, and CloudFormation. We will discuss how to organize an efficient
    development process using SageMaker Studio and Notebooks as well as how to integrate
    with your favorite IDE. We will also review troubleshooting your DL code using
    SageMaker Local Mode. We will review various SageMaker capabilities that allow
    us to organize and manage datasets and discuss various storage options on AWS
    and their application use cases.'

    will provide practical guidance on setting up the first DL project on SageMaker
    and then building, training, and using a simple DL model. We will provide a follow-along
    implementation of this project so that readers can learn and experiment with the
    core SageMaker capabilities themselves.'

    overview of both open source training distribution frameworks as well as innate
    SageMaker libraries for distributed training.'

    using the PyTorch and Hugging Face frameworks. Readers will follow along with
    the code to learn how to prepare a training script for distributed training on
    Amazon SageMaker and then monitor and further optimize the training job. We will
    use the SageMaker Data Parallel library for distributing training computations.'

    will learn how to configure their endpoint deployment and batch inference jobs
    using a Python SDK.'
