- en: Deep learning enables efficient and accurate learning from massive amounts of
    data. Deep learning is being adopted by numerous industries at an increasing pace
    since it can help solve a number of challenges that cannot easily be solved by
    means of traditional machine learning techniques.

- en: Developers working with R will be able to put their knowledge to work with this
    practical guide to deep learning. This book provides a hands-on approach to implementation
    and associated methodologies that will have you up and running and productive
    in no time. Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts and
    practical examples, you will begin by exploring deep learning in general, including
    an overview of deep learning advantages and architecture. You will explore the
    architecture of various deep learning algorithms and understand their applicable
    fields. You will also learn how to build deep learning models, optimize hyperparameters,
    and evaluate model performance.

- en: The target audience of this book is data analysts, machine learning engineers,
    and data scientists who are familiar with machine learning and want to consolidate
    their knowledge of deep learning or make their machine learning applications more
    efficient using R. We assume that the reader has a programming background with
    at least some common machine learning techniques and previous experience or familiarity
    with R.

    Basics*, reviews all the essential elements of machine learning. This quick refresher
    is important as we move into deep learning, a subset of machine learning, which
    shares a number of common terms and methods.'

    Deep Learning*, summarizes the common frameworks and algorithms for deep learning
    and reinforced deep learning in R. You will become familiar with the common libraries,
    including MXNet, H2O, and Keras, and learn how to install each library in R.'

    Networks*, teaches you about artificial neural networks, which make up the base building
    block for all deep learning. You will build a simple artificial neural network
    and learn how all of its components combine to solve complex problems.'

    how to use convolutional neural networks for image recognition. We will briefly
    cover why these deep learning networks are superior to shallow nets. The remainder
    of the chapter will cover the components of a convolutional neural network with
    considerations for making the most appropriate choice.'

    neural network for signal detection. You will learn the architecture of multilayer
    perceptron neural networks, and also learn how to prepare data, define hidden
    layers and neurons, and train a model using a backpropagation algorithm in R.'

    begins with removing parts of documents that should not be considered and tokenizing
    the remaining text. Afterward, embeddings are applied and clusters are created.
    These clusters are then used to make document summaries. We will also learn to
    code a **Restricted Boltzmann Machine** (**RBM**) along with defining Gibbs Sampling,
    Contrastive Divergence, and Free Energy for the algorithm. The chapter will conclude
    with compiling multiple RBMs to create a deep belief network.'
